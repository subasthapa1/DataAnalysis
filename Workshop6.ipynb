      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">WALL-E is a very popular Oscar-winning film, so my giving it a 6 must seem like sacrilege. However, I don't do this just to buck convention or be a jerk---I just thought it didn't have a particularly good plot. As for the animation, not surprisingly, it's absolutely beautiful--probably the prettiest CGI film to date.<br/><br/>The story begins on a desolate Earth. Everywhere is garbage and the crumbling bits of a long-dead city are the home of WALL-E the robot. Apparently, his job is to help clean up the mess and it's obvious he has been doing it for centuries. You see no other robots, so you assume that they have long since ceased functioning. This portion of the movie lasts quite a while--with no dialog and not much story.<br/><br/>A bit later, a probe lands on the Earth and WALL-E is thrilled because he apparently is lonely. The other robot seemed rather reticent to engage with WALL-E, but WALL-E follows 'Eve' like a stalker. Eventually, Eve finds a lone plant and pulls it inside its shell. Then she seems to shut down. However, a ship soon arrives and brings her back to a huge space cruiser filled with weeble-like humans. It seems that Eve's purpose was to seek out evidence of life on Earth so that the humans can return after a 700 year absence. It seems that they made the planet pretty uninhabitable in the 2100s and now, perhaps, it's time to go home. However, there is an unexpected glitch that may prevent the ship from returning.<br/><br/>My problems with the story have to do with anthropomorphizing the robots. They are NOT human and they cannot possess feelings--yet in this Disney world they do. Well, this is hard to believe, but even if this is so, the robots only have a bit of a personality. They are not so lovable and they have very limited vocabularies. Because of that, the first 39 minutes are pretty dull, as there isn't much to do other than watch WALL-E (for the first 15 or so minutes) or Eve and WALL-E for the next 24 minutes. Once the humans are involved, it gets a bit better--but only just a bit. Most of this final segment of the film seems to be chase scenes and the humans are given practically no personality as well. I don't see how kids sat still during the movie and I assume this is a film that critics loved but I can't imagine younger kids loving with the same fervor as TOY STORY or MONSTERS, INC..<br/><br/>Overall, a lovely film to look at so I give it a 7 just for the amazing artistry, but a rather unexpectedly dull story keeps it from a higher score. I know that puts me in a small minority, but this seems like Pixar's most overrated film. Heck, the short film that preceded WALL-E (PRESTO) was much better than the film that followed.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I heard mixed reviews on WALL-E, there were those who said it was magical, and those who said it was one of the most overrated movies ever. I will say I loved this movie, it is a truly beautiful movie. It could have done with being a tad longer perhaps, but essentially this is more than a movie with A List vocal talents, WALL-E has genuine heart and will definitely enchant children and any Pixar fan. All I will say is that I am sorry it took me such a long time to see it, I will admit I was differing whether I should see it or not. But I am glad I did. The animation is simply incredible, the whole film is wonderful to look at. The whole movie is done in a very sophisticated visual style, and the bright colours and sublime backgrounds were a delight to the eyes. The music is stunning, the orchestral themes are gorgeous but the song from Hello Dolly! was great and fitted in with the story well. Speaking of the story, it may seem thin to some, but it is a very simple heart warming one all the same with depth and poignancy. There are some very imaginative moments, such as the zero-gravity dance and the ride through space. The voice cast that includes Fred Willard, Sigourney Weaver and Pixar regular John Ratzenburger did an exceptional job, and all the characters were endearing. What made the movie was WALL-E himself, he has to be one of the most lovable and in-depth Pixar characters ever, and the writers create a very haunting atmosphere in the early scenes to match our little hero's isolation. All in all, brilliant, quite possibly one of the best films of 2008. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Wall-E (2008) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Pixar film takes place seven-hundred years in the future when Earth is empty of humans because of all the trash they left behind. Wall-E is a robot system who cleans up the trash but after years of loneliness our hero comes across a new robot who is here to see if humans can return. Soon the two are on a trip through space with the human race up for grabs. I can't say this film knocked me over as much as I was expecting but there's no doubt this is a very strong film. I was mainly attracted to the film after reading interviews with the production team when they said this was very much a silent picture and that's what they were going for. I think that was a great description and they certainly did their homework as the character Wall-E really comes off like a Charles Chaplin type character. I think the film also owes a bit to Spielberg's E.T. but that's certainly not a bad thing. The animation is downright flawless and the imagination behind it is simply mind blowing. The opening thirty-minutes were probably my favorite as we see what appears to be skyscrapers but on closer viewing it's just the trash that Wall-E has been gathering. The visuals in these early scenes are quite remarkable and that includes the house Wall-E lives in with various items that he's collected over time. The stuff on the space ship is just as entertaining with all the references to Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. The one thing that bothered me about the film were the \"human\" characters. I'm guessing there was a point in having all of them look alike but I never really cared for any of them and whenever they were on screen I kept thinking they were taking away from the real fun, which was the robots.</div>\n",

Humanity under BnL Corp has taken off on giant cruise spaceships for a 5 year tour but they have been gone for much longer. Meanwhile they have left garbage collecting robots like WALL·E to clean up the earth. It spends it's days packing garbage into cubes. Then one day, an advanced robot EVE is dropped off to do reconnaissance. EVE collects samples and blasts everything that moves. When WALL-E shows EVE a plant, her mission is complete and she is retrieved by a spaceship. WALL-E follows EVE and grabs a ride back to cruise ship. It finds the human race are now chubby blobs who are always eating and sitting on their floating chairs.<br/><br/>This is a cute movie. There is no dialog with the robots. The use of robotic beeps and tones create their voices. It's as much fun as any of the best silent movies staring Chaplin or Keaton. Most of the movie takes place without human dialog. It is imaginative and original. It is another one of the amazing offerings from PIXAR.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I was skeptical when I heard that this was a movie about machines falling in love. This kind of thing has been done before and has left me cold. This movie, however, takes a character who has endured in his lot, a romantic robot at that, and gives him a chance to realize his dreams. He has learned about love from watching a dull old Disney-like musical. One of those forgettable things that children hated, but were frequently brought to by their parents. He has established himself a sentient being with a loving soul. One day a slick rocket ship drops a probe into his garbage infested landscape. It is a porcelain-like, egg shaped beauty with deadly capabilities needed for self-preservation. This critter is egg shaped, unlike Wall-e's dumpy presence. He falls in love with her (she is definitely quite feminine. Like all desperate males, he does what he can to impress her, almost at the expense of his existence. The other interesting aspect of this film is the human element. Humanity has devolved into fat, slovenly lumps, with no thoughts or ambitions. When Wall-e shows up in their spaceship, he throws a wrench into the works. This little commentary is inadequate. Mainly, I found the whole thing quite charming and the evolving love affair believable.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Wall-E starts off unusually enough with little dialogue but show tunes from a Barbara Streisand film. A lone garbage compacting robot in a desolate, waste ridden earth of the future until one day a ship lands and unleashes a female robot, Eve who leaves him smitten. In fact the film makes it plain repeatedly that Wall-E is in love.<br/><br/>There is another story of a ship on a centuries old journey where the humans have evolved to be obese and rather lazy. These are the descendants of the people who escaped from the rubbish strewn planet, the ship has a nominal captain but most of the real work is done by a computer.<br/><br/>The film although coming in from another angle of a robot wanting, even needing affection and finding it which leads him to a journey in space then falls for some dependable Disney/Pixar plot points. There has to be a villain with a hidden agenda, there will be some pulsating but humorous chase scenes.<br/><br/>Also if the humans spend all their time on those hover chairs drinking fizzy drink all day, who was the person having the time to have babies because we get the impression that these people were too busy or empty to have personal relationships.<br/><br/>The animation is of a very high standard but the start might be deemed to be slow and the film looks flawed if you examine it too carefully. Also the film ends up paying a homage to 2001:A space odyssey.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">In the Twentieth-Eighth Century, Earth is completely depleted and with the ecological system destroyed. The powerful corporation Buy N Large builds a huge spacecraft called Axiom and sends the entire civilization for a five-year cruise while trash collector robots called WALL-E (Waste Allocator Load Lifter  Earth) would clean the planet. However, the equipment fail and seven-hundred year later, only a single robot WALL-E is performing his duty. His only companion is a cockroach and his great entertainment is watching an old \"Hello Dolly\" videotape. When a spaceship lands on Earth out of the blue and leaves the probe Eve, WALL-E follows her and falls in love for Eve. After a hostile initial contact, the dangerous Eve gets close to WALL-E and he gives a small plant to her. Eve gets the plant and automatically sends a signal to the spaceship that returns and takes Eve back. However, the desperate WALL-E grabs on the hull and travels through the space chasing Eve until they reach Axiom and find a full automated facility crowded by lazy and fat human beings unable even of walking with their legs. The expectation of life on Earth brings hope to the Captain against the will and prime direction of the auto-pilot that organizes a mutiny on board.<br/><br/>\"WALL-E\" is one of the best animations I have ever seen, with adorable characters and a deep story, showing a possible scenario of the depletion of our planet caused by the lack of concern from the big corporations with the environment. In addition, there is the beautiful love story of WALL-E, the importance of small and forgotten things; a great nostalgia of the old times among many other message. The story is very well developed in spite of having very few dialogs. My vote is ten.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): \"WALL-E\"</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">It took me a minute to get round to seeing this film, mainly due to letting the kids clear out of the cinema and the hype / pester power effect on the audience demographic settle down some. Finally getting to see it for myself I was pleased to find that it is the probably the most accomplished Pixar film since, well, since the last one. Of course the most obvious way that things has stepped up yet again is technically as the film is beautifully animated with even convincing dust hanging in the atmosphere and even the humans \"real\" (well, real in the context of the Pixar universe anyway). The level of detail is not only technically impressive but also impressive in the imagination and creativity in making this world and characters. However its in the characters where the film is most impressive. Without a great deal of dialogue to speak of it is amazing that the film manages to create characters that are not only cute and funny but also that the audience care about and for, and this is what the film achieves, making Wall-E an ET for this generation. The plot operates on two levels and the characters are most important for the simple, very human, love story between Wall-E and Eve. This thread is charmingly delivered throughout and it is hard not to feel for Wall-E as he seeks out the simple feelings and gestures that he has watched nightly for hundreds of years.<br/><br/>Operating above this is a plot that owes a debt to Silent Running in the same way as Wall-E himself owes something to Huey and Dewey. With a heavier hand at the wheel, this would have been a very preachy and obvious eco-message but with Stanton it is actually pretty smart and manages to reach children without being clumsy and obvious for adults. Actually this also applies to the humour as well because there is not so much of a duality where aspects of the film are divided  so the character falling over is for kids but the one-liner that follows is for adults; instead Wall-E pretty much pitches everything to the benefit of the film and story. OK so we still get the references but they are not put in so much as woven in  hard to explain perhaps but if you watch this versus, for example, Shrek, you'll see what I mean  Wall-E is not some pop-culture reference-driven film that will be old in a few years once people forget who the celebs were that year. This strengths the film further by just feeling like an all-round engaging and enjoyable film  OK the level or depth that you watch it to will vary between adults and children, but it is this that is different  not WHAT they are watching so much as how.<br/><br/>The \"cast\" of the film are really the animators because, aside from a nice touch of casting in Weaver, the majority of work is done by them. As such Wall-E and Eve are very expressive considering what they are. It is all in tiny movements on the \"faces\" and in the body language  actors struggle to always do it without dialogue so how much harder is it to get it right when you are creating it on a computer? The answer I guess would be \"much harder\" which is why it is so impressive that with barely a word spoken we manage to care so much for these robots.<br/><br/>Wall-E will almost certainly win the Oscar for Best Animated Feature but, for probably the first time, Pixar have a film that genuinely deserves consideration for Best Feature  it is that engaging, well crafted and charming and manages to do that for all sections of the audience without resorting to the oft-used (and mostly fun) \"one for me, one for you\" style of some of these films.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Apart from Cars (which as I heard will get a sequel, surprisingly for me at least), every movie Pixar made until this point in time, was at least excellent, imho. And even Cars, was still pretty good, just never hit as high, as the other ones did. WALL-E is proof yet again, that there is only one true animation champ! <br/><br/>Yes there are other good, funny animated movies, from other studios, but only Pixar has a strong enough story to mix with all the little jokes. Only they can appeal to a young audience and a mature one. Wall-E seems like a strange idea. Something that might not get you emotional involved (the main characters are derived of many facial expressions, due to the fact, that they are robots and are lacking some facial similarity to a human being. Yes there are the eyes, but many other things are absent. Not that you would want to have it any other way. The movie is pretty silent (especially in the first part of the movie), but you still get attached to this robot being.<br/><br/>There are many in-jokes for the mature audience, a message delivered with the right notes and many other funny things, that makes WALL-E one of the best movies. Not only in 2008, but overall.</div>\n",

This happens from time to time and then I start second guessing myself. But you know, one doesn't have to like what everyone else does, and in that respect, there's a fair amount of negative reviews for this picture as well.

In the scene where WALL-E goes to the spaceship, he finds people inhabiting it. Specifically, humanity has degenerated into the types of people depicted in Mike Judge's dystopian \"Idiocracy\": braindead couch potatoes addicted to the latest products and having no real interaction with each other. Is that where we're headed?<br/><br/>Anyway, it's an interesting movie. Not the greatest movie by any measure, but worth seeing. I liked the references to Stanley Kubrick's \"2001\".</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">In the distant future, a small waste collecting robot inadvertently embarks on a space journey that will ultimately decide the fate of mankind.<br/><br/>What makes this film so great is how for most of the film (at least the first half), most of the story is told silently. Or, that is, at least without dialogue. To do that and still hold an audience's attention is a good feat. The artwork is also amazing, quite possibly the best Pixar film up to this point (2014).<br/><br/>The ecology theme is nice, but more than a little blunt. A ship full of fat earthlings who are so lazy they do not even know they have a pool? Now, it is one thing to say the future has the planet covered in trash (\"Idiocracy\" made a similar claim), but this is just too blunt...</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I like many of the Disney Pixar films that have come out, so I couldn't resist this latest helping from the successful creators of Toy Story and Monsters, Inc., from director Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo). In the distant future (and if we're not careful, possible to happen) mankind has left the Earth because of the planet being completely covered with trash from products of powerful multi-national Buy N Large corporation. Alone on this planet is little garbage collecting robot WALL·E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-class) (Ben Burtt) cleaning up the mess, a robot with a personality, fascinated with much of the human items in the pile of rubbish. One day, WALL·E finds a plant growing, and not too long after, a ship carrying EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator) (Elissa Knight), a probe-droid, looking for signs of life shows up. It is when EVE sees the plant found by WALL·E that the ship comes back to collect \"her\", and out hero follows her all the way to the space cruise city ship with all humans evacuated 700 years ago. All humans by the way eat meals from a straw and are carried by hover chairs as they have become large with laziness, and losing bones, so they can barely move. EVE is determined to get the plant to the Captain (Jeff Garlin), who is fascinated by Earth after the brief good news, which comes to life again when he knows life on Earth can exist. The ship's computer AUTO (MacInTalk, a talking technology created by Apple), obviously inspired by HAL 9000 in 2001: A Space Odyssey, is determined to stop the Captain taking everyone back to Earth, so it is up to WALL·E and EVE to save the day. Also starring American Pie: The Wedding's Fred Willard (the real one) as Shelby Forthright - BnL CEO, John Ratzenberger as John, Kathy Najimy as Mary and Sigourney Weaver as Ship's Computer. The animation and effects of this film, including my favourite sight of space, are extraordinary, and of course WALL·E is a great robot who without speaking (like Dumbo) can be lovable, a great family film. It won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, and it was nominated the Oscar for Best Music, Original Score for Thomas Newman, Best Song for \"Down to Earth\" (also nominated the Golden Globe), Best Sound, Best Sound Editing and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it won the BAFTA for Best Animated Film and the BAFTA Children's Award for Best Feature Film, and it was nominated for Best Music and Best Sound, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature Film, and it was nominated for Best Original Song for \"Down to Earth\", and it won the National Movie Award for Best Family Film. Very good!</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Boy, the visuals were as stunning as I had read they were; absolutely spectacular. I hate to use this cliché, but this is a \"must\" for Blu-Ray fans. You have to see - and hear - this film in HD because it is a great treat for your senses. The surround sounds are everywhere while the colors and artwork are something to behold! And, yes - it's still very pretty on a regular DVD, too.<br/><br/>The story is \"cute,\" but nowhere near the visuals and audio. It's okay, subtlety humorous, dramatic and romantic parts. It gets a tiny bit preachy with the usual environmental digs and a comment about how fat we humans can get by lying around too much, but otherwise just plays it for comedy and cool-looking characters. Everyone and everything in this film is pretty amazing-looking.<br/><br/>It's kind of a strange story, with much of it taking place on a big space ship. My favorite parts were in the beginning on Earth with the little robot WALL-E and his cockroach friend.<br/><br/>There is so much to see in this film, it makes multiple viewings all the more attractive but, I'll assume, you're always going to catch some things you didn't see the first few times. Overall, not a super story but yet an amazing film, one that is one you want to show off your Blu-Ray DVD player to friends. This sets yet another new standard in animation.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Having enjoyed Pixar's 'Incredibles' and 'Toy Story' trilogy I was keen to see 'Wall-E' when it was on television. The reviews I'd heard suggested that I'd be in for a treat and they weren't wrong; Pixar may make films that are aimed at a younger audience but adults are unlikely to feel childish if they watch them; this is especially true of 'Wall-E'. Set in a distant future where the Earth has been abandoned by humanity because pollution and the build up of garbage has made the planet uninhabitable one small robot toils to tidy up the mess left behind; that robot is Wall-E. Throughout his days he crushes the rubbish into cubes then stacks them in towers that have come to dwarf the city's long abandoned skyscrapers. When he finds items he likes such as an old Rubik's Cube or a small weed he takes it back to his 'home' to store. His existence is changed one day when a spaceship arrives and drops off a shiny new robot who we later learn is called EVE; the two of them become friends and everything goes well for them until he shows her the plant, then she takes it, puts it inside her and shuts down. It appears that her mission was to search for plant life then wait to be retrieved. When this happens she is taken away on the space ship, not wanting to be without her Wall-E clings on and is taken back to the Axiom; the ship where what is left of humanity lives. The people aren't like people now though; they are all over-weight which is hardly surprising as they don't seem to get out of their hover chairs and are waited on by a variety of robots. Once here Wall-E and EVE's adventures are just beginning as they must avoid the security systems and deliver the plant to the scanner which the ships autopilot is determined to stop them doing as it had been informed that Earth would never be suitable for resettlement.<br/><br/>As always with Pixar films the animation was just about flawless, I was surprised however that it was not 100% animated; the various adverts and messages recorded at the time of Earth's abandonment featured live action actors, this was an inspired move as it only served to emphasise how much humanity had changed when we saw the fat CGI people later on. The minimal use of dialogue was a brave idea that worked for me, one would have though that having no dialogue spoken by a main character in the opening twenty minutes and not a huge amount afterwards would lead to a boring film but it was in fact engrossing. The character designs were good; the beaten up look of Wall-E, which reminded me of 'Number Five' from 'Short Circuit' contrasted beautifully with the clean modern EVE. While there were a few nods to other films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey the viewer is unlikely to feel they are missing something if they don't get the reference; as Pixar don't feel it necessary to fill their films with lots of pop culture references I can see this and their other films being watched for decades to come in the way old Disney films can still entertain today's children.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Part cutesy kids story, part serious sci-fi tale, WallE is a love story with robots, an indictment of man's appalling treatment of Earth, and a warning to the human race about what may be waiting for us in the near future. It's also a very entertaining movie, and one of Pixar's finest to date.<br/><br/>WallE is a small robot who is left on a trash-covered Earth as part of a clean-up team, whilst the human population takes a five year sojourn in space. The problem is that five years eventually becomes seven hundred years, Earth is still messy, and WallE is now alone (save for a cockroach who keeps him company).<br/><br/>The little robot's lonely existence comes to an end, however, when a human spacecraft lands on Earth and drops off a high-tech probe to search for plant-life. The little metal guy falls for the shiny white machinenamed Eveand the two form a friendship. But when Eve discovers a small plant, she must obey her programming, and alert her masters of her discovery.<br/><br/>When the ship returns to collect Eve and her precious find and return them to the Axiom, the huge holiday craft that is still cruising through space, WallE decides to hitch along for the ridean action that results in the ultimate human re-population of Earth.<br/><br/>With almost no dialogue in its first half, Pixar's latest triumph begins like a silent movie: with narrative and character development achieved primarily through clever use of 'body' language. WallE, who is part ET and part Johnny 5, is wonderfully expressive, and director Andrew Stanton works miracles with his character, masterfully manipulating his audience into caring for the lump of rusty metal. Likewise, Eve, who is basically a white egg with blue eyes, is just as endearing thanks to the expertise of the Pixar animators and Stanton's faultless direction.<br/><br/>The second half of the film is a wake up call to the human race, showing what will become of us if we become lazy and over-reliant on technology. It's also a pretty nifty action/adventure, with WallE braving space travel to find true love, and helping the overweight humans find their feet again and overthrow the power-mad computer who secretly controls the Axiom.<br/><br/>Although it is perhaps occasionally too sophisticated for younger children, and some of the science could be picked apart by pedants, WallE is nevertheless a brilliantly crafted piece of entertainment which combines an enchanting tale with superb CGI, wonderful comedy and, most importantly, a real sense of fun.<br/><br/>8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Disney/Pixar animation at its most beautiful, but also at its most annoying. In Earth's distant future, trash and refuse has replaced all life on the planet; a waste-reclamation robot (with human emotions and feelings) has a daily routine of condensing and piling up the junk-cubes into skyscrapers made of garbage. WALL·E is an amusing, resourceful, lovable hunk of metal and rubber who is also something of a happy hoarder (his collection includes Christmas lights, utensils, a cigarette lighter, a video-cassette of \"Hello, Dolly!\" and, most importantly, a small plant still encased in dirt). Director Andrew Stanton also co-wrote the screenplay with Jim Reardon (based on Stanton and Pete Docter's idea), and they have fashioned a mind-blowing, heart-tugging first act. WALL·E, whose only friend is a winsome little cockroach (!), is visited one day by EVE, an Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator, who inadvertently leads (and lifts) WALL·E off the Earth and into the galaxy (the film's peak moment) where he discovers obese, computer and soda-addicted humans living on a space station. This is arguably the moment where the movie begins losing some of its heart; Stanton shoots-up on the imaginative possibilities of the circumstance, revving the pace and sending the editing into overdrive (possibly to compensate?). There's a revolt of man-serving machines, a Captains' mutiny with the main power source, comedic elements derived from various popular films, and WALL·E's desire to be reunited with EVE (which is all we really care about). The film goes out of its way to engage younger viewers by immersing itself in cute behavior, cute responses and one-liners, and manic action-action-action. Cuteness is a prerequisite for Disney/Pixar, of course, but Stanton really lays it on thick delivering several false endings, all manipulated for that ultimate sentimental sock. Pixar Goes Green! And that's fine, if not especially amusing. The wondrous, wonderful first half-hour was still far more engaging. *** from ****</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">The movie begins with a \"fly-over\" shot of a large metropolis with tall buildings, but right away we notice something strange about some of them. They have a rather rough form, and eventually we realize that they are very neat piles of compacted rubbish. Each little cube is carefully place to eventually create a tall, tapering building with a flat track spiraling up it.<br/><br/>Then we notice a solitary dual-track, solar-powered machine traveling quickly among the buildings and the rubbish. The front of the machine has the inscription \"WALL-E\" which is an acronym relating to waste management, Earth version. We can also see, among the rubble, that there once were many WALL-E machines in operation but this is the only one still functioning. We wonder what happened.<br/><br/>This little WALL-E is not just a diligent worker, but he has excellent intelligence. He probably made his compacted trash cubes into tall buildings by mimicking what he observed around him. At the end of the day, he retires to the safety of a larger machine which we observe is his home, stocked with interesting things he has pulled out of the rubbish, and spare parts salvaged from broken down machines.<br/><br/>He also has a non-talking sidekick, a curious Cockroach that interacts with WALL-E playfully. But there isn't much else alive in this future version of Earth, where our over-use of consumables has made our world uninhabitable.<br/><br/>The set-up is done so well that during the first few minutes we view WALL-E not so much as a curious machine, but an interesting character with a unique personality. So in everything that transpires afterward we find ourselves pulling for WALL-E. How did our world get this way, and what is going to happen?<br/><br/>State-of-the-art digital animation and a killer surround track, this DVD is not only fun to watch, it is a superb, interesting 90-minute movie. One of the best I have seen in a long time.<br/><br/>Edit: Dec 2016 - Watched it again, the first and final segments on Earth are the best, all the stuff on the Mothership is not as interesting.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: When we piece together all we see, including some select flashbacks, we learn that it is the year 2775. About 700 years earlier, around 2075, a very large space \"cruise ship\" left on a 5-year cruise of the universe, but was told not to return, the Earth was not inhabitable. So presumably WALL-E has been compacting trash and building tall structures for about 700 years, initially with others like him, but now alone. The cruise ship, now commanded by an ancestor of the original commander, sends survey pods out periodically to measure if Earth is safe to return to. One pod is EVE, and \"she\" and WALL-E make friends. They are watching \"Hello Dolly\" together on an old VHS tape and sort of fall in love. But when EVE finds the small green plant that WALL-E brought home, she confiscated it and went into electronic hibernation, eventually picked up by an explorer craft and brought back to the large mothership. WALL-E, being a machine and unhurt, hitched a ride on the outside. The green plant was a sign they could return to Earth, but the ship's computer did not want to allow it. So the rest of the story is the struggle to take back the ship and get it back to Earth. And of course for EVE and WALL-E to remain together.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I never thought I'd say this but... WALL*E is better than Toy Story. This might not seem like such a high claim given how many other wonderful movies from PIXAR have come out over the past 13 years, particularly the ones by Brad Bird (Incredibles and Ratatouille). But since Toy Story blew open the front door for CGI animation, and stood as the pinnacle of awesome, great entertainment and film-making, I wasn't sure if anything could top it. WALL*E does by far, and then some; I'd even say that this is probably the best Disney movie that, technically, they never made. For years Disney, the studio joined at the hip (and now, practically, submissive to whatever PIXAR wants in animation), didn't want to do WALL*E, as it was a somewhat bleak science fiction movie with 3/4 of the movie not featuring any distinct human dialog at all. And, no cute animals talking either; the closest we get here is a cockroach, and, thankfully, we only get cute chirps and squees of joy.<br/><br/>It was a risk, but after waiting for so long to make it, Andrew Stanton has what critics have been dubbing the \"M\" word: masterpiece. It works on the levels that satisfy simply for the levels of a comedy. WALL*E the character is one of those classic character straight out of Disney movies that you don't see ever done this well, or at least this purely: he's wholesome, innocent, curious, lovable and loving to the robot that comes to earth, Eva, looking for any signs of life, and we want to cheer for him every step of the way. It's a quasi-Chaplin character, if Chaplin were obsessed with a video of an old 1950s musical (somehow, in the post-apocalyptic world of 2700, still intact), and only wants to hold Eva's darling hand, despite getting into mishap after mishap and eventually leading to his trip out into space. No quirk of behavior, no amazingly adorable physical bit of comedy is unturned, and every one works, even ones that you don't see coming.<br/><br/>At the same time, it also works as a science fiction parable, one that works splendidly for our times without pushing it down our throats. Its message is one that is general, which is why when poised around satirical overtones on the AXIOM ship- where WALL*E finds Eva bringing a plant to the ship's captain and then stopped by a HAL-9000 type of computer- it's enriched by a context we all know very well. Taking care of the planet and taking care of ourselves physically are points that are put forth without being preachy, and there's lots of good humor to go with that too (the moment when the pudgy captain finally walks, put to Thus Spoke Zarathustra, is one of the funniest damn things I've ever seen). AND, it's also an incredibly touching love story to boot; two robots who can't quite seem to get together until one sees how much the other cares for the other. The simplicity here, too, is awe-inspiring, and like a silent film brings on the tear-ducts in the final moments of suspense.<br/><br/>So, it's a superb comedy, a fully-realized and somewhat original science fiction story (then again what is original entirely), and the best date movie of the summer. On top of this, director Andrew Stanton and the vast PIXAR team have gone once again another leap forward with their technological skills for all use in telling the story. I don't care who you are, adult, child, old dude in a wheelchair, this is top-notch film-making, some of the finest one will see in this new decade of the 21st century. While points ahead to the future of animated movies, it doesn't stop or go corrupt in basic film-making. For those who would be wary of a movie with very little dialog, don't fret: there's enough \"pure\" cinema here to suffice. It left me speechless, in-between laughing and crying and whatnot. Grade: A++</div>\n",

The animation is cute, fun and futuristic. All the cute robots and little jokes (such as the hard working janitor robot) keeps kids entertained. Yet, there are thought provoking messages for adults too. It makes a clear statement about pollution, obesity and wasting time doing nothing. The mechanically hedonistic lifestyle on the Axiom is sarcastic, and yet almost strangely resembles modern day lives. All these statements are presented without being preachy.<br/><br/>It is rare to see a film with a brilliant plot, lovable characters, fun, humour and with a non preachy message. \"Wall-E\" has all these ingredients, and is a great film for both kids and adults.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">WALL-E is a computer-animated post-apocalyptic science fiction film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and directed by Andrew Stanton. The story follows a robot named WALL-E, who is designed to clean up a waste- covered Earth far in the future. He falls in love with another robot named EVE, who also has a programmed task, and follows her into outer space on an adventure that changes the destiny of both his kind and humanity. Both robots exhibit an appearance of free will and emotions similar to humans, which develop further as the film progresses.<br/><br/>After directing Finding Nemo, Stanton felt Pixar had created believable simulations of underwater physics and was willing to direct a film largely set in space. Most of the characters do not have actual human voices, but instead communicate with body language and robotic sounds, designed by Ben Burtt, that resemble voices. In addition, it is the first animated feature by Pixar to have segments featuring live-action characters.<br/><br/>This computer-animated tale is about a wide-eyed robot who travels to the deepest reaches of outer space in search of a newfound friend. The year is 2700, and planet Earth has long been uninhabitable. For hundreds of years, WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) has been taking out the trash, and collecting precious knick-knacks in order to stave off the boredom of his dreary routine. Little does WALL-E realize that he has recently stumbled onto a secret that could save planet Earth, and once again make the ravaged planet safe for all humankind. When highly advanced search robot EVE makes friends with WALL-E and realizes the value of his remarkable discovery, she excitedly races back to let the humans know that there's hope for their home planet after all. But after centuries alone in space, WALL-E can't stand the thought of losing the only friend he's ever known, and eagerly follows her into the deepest reaches of space on the adventure of a lifetime. Along the way, the friendly trash-collecting robot who has always known what he was made for gradually begins to understand what he was meant for.<br/><br/>Charming, audacious, and timely, Wall-E's lighthearted magic and stellar visuals testify once again to Pixar's ingenuity.It is a story about love and loneliness, perseverance and triumph, the possibilities and pitfalls of human existence. That this story is told by way of the exploits of a tiny, faceless robot only makes it more extraordinary.It is one for the ages, a masterpiece to be savored before or after the end of the world - - assuming, like the title character, you're still around when all the humans have taken off and have access to an old video player.</div>\n",

(Jees)<br/><br/>I did enjoy it. Its an amazing experience. But while watching it, I also was admiring the minds behind it. <br/><br/>There are sometimes intelligent movies being made, and a surprising number of them are from Hollywood. I believe though that in most cases, it is because there is a critical mass of intelligent writers, filmmakers and decisionmakers that are working at the fringe of the establishment. Not so with Pixar. I've been constantly surprised at each project how they encapsulate essays in the advance of the cinematic vocabulary.<br/><br/>Its a bit like French new wave films made by film theorists, the films being more about what can be done than doing it in the service of effect that matters. (Their retort would be that it DOES matter if it changes the vehicle.)<br/><br/>But this Pixar business is a different model. Folks can come and be entertained without having to dip into vats of self-reference. Oh, there's plenty of superficial self-reference, but its all in the service of jokes, and they are all in the service of the narrative.<br/><br/>But other folks  like me and perhaps you  can also see that they are doing a few things that no one else is in quite the same advanced way, and they mark them so that you can read it as a sort of metanarrative. Jobs does the same thing with Apple. They make products that people use and like. But they also are in the business of defining what it is to be cool. They manufacture cool like they manufacture electronic products. You get both, and even in the products there's a reference to leadership, because being cool is all in who defines cool.<br/><br/>So when I saw this, I saw self-conscious art, and stories about the future of cinema. We've always gotten that with Pixar. Usually, it has to do with space, and what you can do with this new medium that is impossible with \"real\" cameras and places.<br/><br/>This last movie, \"Ratatouie\" added in the notion of control. Pulling the strings. I'm sure many have noticed that the shorts that Pixar creates to play before these features are a sort of synopsis of the reflective ideas they will use in the film. Last time the short and film were about control at a distance, with both the puppetmaster and puppet being featured, but the star was the puppetmaster. You can almost see how the whole story could have been generated by this idea: chef, French (who claim to have invented folded cinema of the reflexive kind), and rat. Secret recipes. Love always.<br/><br/>This time around, the cinematic sensibilities are profoundly deeper. A deep certainty. You have to know about 2001 as a start. Kubric's interest there was the warring narrator. Whose world is telling the story, man, machine or god. There is a story, but it hardly matters. Its all about who is telling the story, whose chair you sit in as the viewer. Its a masterful work.<br/><br/>Here, its bent only a little: mankind, machine and nature, but its folded back on the story  which here has effect. Wall-e is natural, machine in form, but more human than the humans we see. But watch how they fold it again. Its a movie about the truth in movies, how the power of cinema can reach into the real world. A handholding there and here is a handhold between the worlds. <br/><br/>And also watch how they built movies in. This isn't accidental. When they put a movie within a movie like this, the intent is to have the watcher of the outer movie join the world of the watcher of the inner movie. Its a reliable trick to get us to invest in what we see. But they go further. When we see the humans  who are supposed to be like us but clearly aren't  we note that THEY are hypnotized by the movies in front of them and cannot see the larger world beyond, and we can.<br/><br/>It happens to also spill over into the great narrative about how some of us can see that the planet is being destroyed and other blithely putter on. That business about saving image- laden artifacts as a memory storehouse... All these layers  yes they are engineered by what is now the most intelligent and adventuresome narrative engineering lab in a studio.<br/><br/>All this extra introspection is used not as dry thesis, but in the service of the love story. It made it deeper, and more true. Knowing makes love true. So yes, it is effective, and fun, and deep.To compensate, the camera and space manipulation is less radical than usual.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Why would a 49 year-old guy watch \"Bratz\"? Well, he could be a totally sick freak (I swear, I am not...though that's what freaks would say also...but I am not!!). But in my case (again, I swear) it's because I have a goal of seeing as many horrible films as possible before I die. I am not talking about run of the mill bad--those films I avoid. I am talking about really, really, REALLY bad movies. So, after seeing all 50 of the films on Harry Medved's amazing book \"The 50 Worst Films of All Time\", I needed a new challenge--IMDb's Bottom 100 list. While I have made a very impressive dent on this list, some films (such as the Turkish ones) are just about impossible to find with subtitles or dubbing AND they keep adding films all the time to the list (such as \"Bratz\" which only recently entered the list despite being released in 2007).<br/><br/>I should point out that technically, \"Bratz\" is not a bad film in the traditional sense. The cinematography, sets, costumes (the the girls wear thousands each) and music are all very professional--so I think a score of 1 is unmerited--even if it IS a vacuous film. When I say vacuous, I mean that it is written with no subtlety and is designed for incredibly stupid kids in the 10-14 age bracket. Now if you have a valueless, undemanding and rather clueless kid in this age group and you like them to be this way, then perhaps it IS a film to rent or even buy. After all, while very, very stupid, the film is squeaky clean--as the corporate types behind this mega-marketed film know this would make the film non-threatening and acceptable viewing for this age group.<br/><br/>So why is the writing so bad? Wow...this is like shooting fish in a barrel! The characters are all completely one-dimensional and more caricatures than something written by a professional screenwriter. The nasty girl at school is 0% real--but so are the four 'Bratz'. These girls are all PERFECT and represent carefully coiffed images--sort of like junior Spice Girls. One is great at math and science....and hot. One is great at music....and hot. One is brilliant....and hot. And the other is great at sports...and hot. This film is about their fabulous adventures in high school*.<br/><br/>Now I must interject something that really bothered me about this film. As I mentioned above, this is just a corporate attempt to further whore off the Bratz name. The Bratz dolls are marketed to young kids--very young kids. And, in a completely cynical attempt to be BOTH non-threatening and pretending to be inclusive, three of the Bratz are ethnic. Now I am NOT talking ethnic is a real manner. Nope. It's a CORPORATE style of ethnicity. The black girl has non-brown eyes, talks EXACTLY like any white kid and is groomed just like a white kid. The Asian kid is vaguely Asian and you only know that she is part Asian at the film's conclusion when you see her mother. And, the Hispanic kid looks 100% non-Hispanic white and speaks with no accent and throws out occasional Spanish words for no discernible reason. As for her family, like the actress they don't look or sound the least bit Hispanic (Lainie Kazan?!). When this girl and her mother sing \"La Cucaracha\", it is pathetic--with no accent AND they don't even know the words! But wait...they at least have a disabled kid, right?! Well, sort of. He's hot, does NOT wear a hearing aid or cochlear implant (they would be SO gross....ewww!!) and yet, inexplicably, speaks perfectly and seems to function 100% normally. In fact, to deafness, he's a lot like what Daredevil is to blindness!! I really think that the corporate-type schmucks responsible for this terrible film just think that REAL blacks, Asians, Hispanics and disabled kids are not stylish enough to be in a Bratz film.<br/><br/>A few final quibbles. First, how did Jon Voigt get in this film? Does he need the money THAT badly? If so, I am sure we could all take up a collection to help him avoid similar mistakes in the future. Second, I cannot believe that the film managed to insert classical music into it--making me almost hate the tunes. Third, I know I am thinking too much here, but who would let the bad girl bring a dog to school? I know her dad is supposed to be the principal, but bringing along a dog (obviously a knockoff of \"Legally Blonde\") just shows bad writing (duh...this IS a bad film!!). Overall, I see \"Bratz\" as a vapid, valueless and crappy film with no redeeming merits. And, given its place on the IMDb Bottom 100, I can tell that I'm not alone here!<br/><br/>*Oddly, while the characters all appear to be about high school age, I cannot imagine high school-age kids watching this one unless you drug them!</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Despite my indifference towards the Bratz dolls and disliking what they stand for, and disliking just as much the 2005 CGI-animated show, seeing as there are good examples of musical, comedy and high school films so gave 'Bratz' the benefit of the doubt with an open mind. Plus Jon Voigt has shown that he can be good if the material is (i.e. 'Midnight Cowboy').<br/><br/>Although expectations were not high to begin with, 'Bratz' managed to not only be exactly what was expected but be worse. It gets points for some nice bright colours which stops it from being one of the all-time worst films, but that is pretty much the only very faint praise. The 2005 show, as very bad as it was, at least tried to incorporate some unoriginal but important morals and relevant relatable issues. This film also does both, but they are not just ones done to death in every kind of visual media in existence but they are delivered also with the subtlety of a sledge-hammer and in no way feel meaningful.<br/><br/>They are also further disadvantaged by the stereotyping, it's not just one or two aspects or characters that are stereotypical. Everything is stereotyped to the maximum, seeming like every one in existence, and in a way that make tea party saucers and very shallow water when swimming in the sea look deep in comparison. The un-subtlety is similarly applicable here as it is in the morals/issues 'Bratz' tries to show, the stereotypes are excessive in number, over-exaggerated and a few are not for the easily offended. Not in a while have more shallow and unlikeable characters graced any film by me seen by me recently, they all live up to their names as brats with personalities that never sparkle and instead make one depressed and they serve as unhealthy role models for the primary target audience.<br/><br/>Other than the bright colours, there is a real straight-to-video/DVD look to 'Bratz'. It strives for glitz but ends up being pure garish tack with unexceptional at best amateurish at worst filming. The songs written for the film are repetitive and irritate fast, even the worst of the songs heard in the charts today are more tolerable than the songs here. They are also sung with variable sense of pitch, lacklustre energy and nasal, and at times shouty, poorly recorded voices that are far more unpleasant than the worst singing of Disney Channel stars. The choreography is lazy and danced with awkwardness.<br/><br/>Calling the script stilted and shallow are insults to those words. It's truly cringe-worthy, forced and vapid, so poorly delivered and has no substance whatsoever. The story is non-existent thin and would strain to sustain even a half an hour television episode let alone a feature length film.<br/><br/>And now we come to the acting, have not seen acting this appalling in quite some time. Everyone either looks like they are on autopilot or are so over the top that one feels ashamed for struggling to laugh out loud. There is no discernible chemistry between them either, with the titular characters it is hard to believe that they are friends with the way they interact and believe.<br/><br/>Of the performances, Chelsea Staub as Meredith gives perhaps one of the worst performances ever. Similarly, once again (just when you think he couldn't get just as bad as his career-low-point, film and performance, in 'Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2'), Jon Voigt disgraces himself with an bumbling idiot role (that is actually meant to be an authority figure) overacted dreadfully, and no obviously prosthetic/false nose won't give you any dignity sadly Jon no matter how hard you try to hide behind it by looking barely recognisable.<br/><br/>In conclusion, lots of brat-itude but no style or substance of any kind. 2/10 Bethany Cox</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Let me be clear here first of all: I'm in my twenties, and I saw Bratz, but not for any kind of simple lewd intentions at gawking at sexy teens in gobs of make-up and slutty clothes. My intentions were a little more pure, on a movie-geek level. Or rather, I went in with the expectation that it *would* be a bad movie, and even one that would go to such ridiculous lengths as to be awesomely bad, to the level of something like Ghost Rider, where taking it seriously would provide brain damage, and by not would give some form of entertainment (especially if you have friends to make jokes with during the movie, which for something like Bratz isn't inappropriate to 'ruin' for the rest of the audience). It's a staggering, warped view of high school life, the connections made in 'cliques' and social order, and about the bonding between girls who can't get enough of talking to each other through their web-cams. It also has enough montages to kill a few horses, Jon Voight with not only a prosthetic nose but a statue of his head with the same fake nose, a fluffy dog who gets beauty treatment along with her owner, a mariachi band that lives at the house of the Hispanic girl of the Bratz (and, for some reason, this doesn't seem too out of place, especially when they show up at talent shows), and...Jesus, did I mention the montages?<br/><br/>But for all of this, if one is in the right frame of mind, it's hilarious, even achingly and hysterically, funny material, whether it was intentional or not. Frankly, I'm sure that the filmmakers didn't quite know what they were doing outside of making a big long commercial with the intellectual value of Tropicana fruit punch. But on those levels it almost works at times at looking like an unintentional satire; what is one to make of the symbolism of the heightened security at the high school envisioned by the school emblem and trophies: a hand holding an ax, with little figures holding the axes all over the school in one form or another? It also makes for some ample absurd moments when just seeing the four Bratz having a fight amongst themselves about sticking together or going off into their other interests (naturally, they have only one aptitude a piece, one soccer, one cheer-leading, one science, and one journalism/singing), and as well the diabolical attempts to thwart all of their fun by the nasty, less than one-note daughter of the principle, who goes for a 2nd super sweet sixteen party even after she's turned 16.<br/><br/>Maybe if you're already quite a young girl, seeing this movie might not matter too much in the grand scheme of things as far as real psychological impact. But at the same time if one were to look objectively, Bratz's message is a little scrambled and quite off in any positive aspect. Does one stick with friends or act individualist or, um, like, go into another clique or another table? How about staying fashionable, in the glammed up style that the girls go to lengths to do- leading up to, of course, the Bratz mobile that they walk out of to the climactic talent show- even in the face of peril? It really doesn't serve any artistic integral purpose whatsoever either. So, in the end, it works best as a so-bad-it's-still-bad-but-uproarious treat for those who gorge on works that slip by in pop culture that are so sapped with the vigor of commercialism that to read through the mixed messages would take a pot of coffee and a fine-toothed comb. But along the way, it's got montages, and songs, LOTS of songs- which are, as one might imagine who doesn't listen to Radio Disney, the worst trash possible right now. Brattitude!!</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Bratz (2007): Dir: Sean McNamara / Cast: Nathalia Ramos, Janel Parrish, Skyler Shaye, Logan Browning, Chelsea Staub: Boring formula retread about attitude based on the popular dolls. They are four females entering high school and going against trends. Eventually the girls split into their interests developing new friendships while their bond fades. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that they will get back together and win the talent contest. Sets are colourful and directing by Sean McNamara is fine but acting is a major issue. Nathalia Ramos, Janel Parrish, Skyler Shaye, and Logan Browning are not promising. They dress up in colourful costumes, prance about and give slow motion hair wave shots. Chelsea Staub plays the scheming brat who attempts to place everyone into their different cliques. Similar to Mean Girls but lacking the message and character of that film. Unlike Mean Girls, the characters here are about as enticing as a punch in the face. Its only real drive is its capitalizing on the success of the dolls. This film is purely aimed at young girls who can hopefully know the difference between real personalities and a hunk of plastic. Bratz is not a famous enough product to warrant its own movie let alone deserve one. In the end it is all marketing to the lowest denominator, which unfortunately taps in at young girls. As for adults, the film is about as exciting as a kick to the crotch. Score: 3 / 10</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Bratz, based off the wildly popular line of dolls, is actually a much more tolerable film than the one I was expecting to be greeted with. Rather than a shallow, frothy, candy-colored stroll through ditzy women, inappropriate fashion, and immature circumstances, I received a mildly-entertaining, high-energy romp filled with attractive leads, all of whom at least carry their part with some semblance of conviction, acceptable, if scatter-plotted themes and ideas, and a pleasantly fun diversion through the world that sort of mimics our reality but still finds itself wholly trapped in cinema's, family-friendly kind of reality.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, Bratz isn't really a good film and it wouldn't be the first thing I recommend your daughters see. However, for a film that concerns three teen girls who are obsessed with fashion and self-expression, we could've been handed a much more harmful piece of cinema. Even as a male child, I always wondered why so much outrage and hate was directed at Barbie, who predicated herself off of being a good-natured sweetheart, was always the subject of vehement feminist controversy while the Bratz doll-line went under the radar, with their skimpy attire, makeup-heavy faces, and distracting artificiality. You want to talk about giving young girls the false sense of beauty and exercising the gender roles? The Bratz essentially were telling them not to leave the house without a tube-top, eyeliner, and eyeshadow.<br/><br/>Bratz follows four lifelong best-friends - Cloe (Skyler Shaye), Yasmin (Nathalia Ramos), Sasha (Logan Browning), and Jade (Janel Parrish) - as they enter high school with an attitude to keep each other as close as possible. However, they are heavily burdened by the idea that the self-indulgent, wildly narcissistic class president Meredith Baxter Dimly (Chelsea Kane) wants to identify every student by what clique they should belong to, forcing nothing but social segregation in the already ominous halls of high school. Of course, Meredith finds the free-spirited girls disgusting and offsetting to her plan, but finds little to worry after two years of high school.<br/><br/>Yes, by junior year, the lifelong friends have become nothing but faces in crowded hallways to each other, drifting towards their own sort of cliques, falling victim to Meredith's plan to keep all students part of their own little class of people. Cloe becomes invested in soccer, Sasha becomes a gifted and determined cheerleader, Jade embraces her inner-scientist with the chemistry club, and Yasmin sort of watches it all happen, while quietly participating in journalism. Yet the girls are brought together by four colossal, incredulous misunderstands at lunchtime, which reminds them that they have fallen prey to Meredith's system. Upon reuniting the group to prove that they can still be inseparable and devoted to each other, Meredith sets out to destroy the girls by recreating the party she threw for her sweet sixteen, making it even bigger and better, which she hopes will propel herself to the known voice of the school while the four girls wallow in their shame.<br/><br/>I laud Bratz for at least doing what I never thought would be done in one of the most ostensibly shallow teen films of the last decade, which is etch some solid, vital commentary about high school into its material. While many films have addressed the abundance of cliques and groups in high school, Bratz recognizes the problem with it, which is that kids get the idea that they shouldn't be seen with kids of different cliques, which stunts their emotional and mental growth all the more. Yes, Bratz would be better if it didn't make the cliques so overblown and farcical that they tread the line of being part of a high school satire, but its acknowledgment of a real problem in a pleasantly real way is actually heartwarming to say the least.<br/><br/>Then there's the abundance of singing, dancing, and just hanging out these girls do, which is surprisingly fun and enjoyable, given how shallow it sounds. These are teen girls being teen girls, minus the sarcastic and childish lingo utilized on contemporary kids shows like iCarly and Victorious, but also without the biting wit and commentary of something like Mean Girls, one of this particular's decades smartest teen films.<br/><br/>Bratz essentially wants to be a flashier, more stylistically-potent Mean Girls, but its reliance on scenes that are too goofy and ridiculous to be taken seriously and its repetitive nature are what hinder it from living up to what it could be. The visuals are eye-popping, the music is catchy, if existing from the often forgettable subgenre of bubblegum pop that expires quickly, and the four leads are all charming with their smiley charisma and micro-mini fashionista sense, but the film simply has too much going on to really settle on a focus and it bogged down by scenes that are either not funny or heavy-handed in their moralizing. But the fact that there's moralizing in a film called Bratz, taken from the line of dolls that look the way they do, is surprising enough, giving the film much more leverage and likability than I could've ever imagined.<br/><br/>Starring: Skyler Shaye, Nathalia Ramos, Logan Browning, Janel Parrish, and Chelsea Kane. Directed by: Sean McNamara.</div>\n",

Directed by Sean McNamara who directed Casper Meets Wendy and Raise Your Voice and Avi Ardid(who co founded Marvel with the late Stan Lee)who serves as producer; the film centers on 4 girls Chloe,Sacha,Yasmin and Jade who all attend high school together. But when a popular girl named Meridith wants to break the 4 girls apart,will they sort out their differences.<br/><br/>If your a fan of the Bratz dolls then you may like this film. It's silly,childish and just average. Angelina Jolie dad Jon Voight plays Principal Dibley(yes I am really not kidding here as he is the godfather of the actress who plays Chloe.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">There are some really awful kids movies, but this might just be scraping the bottom of the barrel. This has to have one of the worst scripts, dumbest premises, and characters who try to teach diversity through stereotypes. Only the very young can enjoy this, and everyone else will just hate it.<br/><br/>Sasha (Logan Browning), Jade (Janel Parrish), Yasmin (Nathalia Ramos) and Cloe (Skyler Shae) are all best friends and going into their first year of high school together, but at Dimly high school, you need to belong to a clique. Principal Dimly's daughter Meredith (Chelsea Staub) will make sure of this, as she hands out what clique each person will belong to. Eventually, even the four girls (aka the bratz) give in. A few years later, they are no longer friends, but thanks to a bizarre spontaneous schoolwide food fight, they become friends again. Now they must stop the school from separating everyone into groups and they must defeat the uber-popular Meredith.<br/><br/>This movie is filmed like a music video mixed with a commercial. There is constant use of slow motion, which grows obnoxious after one use, and the characters constantly stare at the camera up close, which looks like a mouthwash commercial or something. It's annoying.<br/><br/>Speaking of annoying...these characters....they are almost intolerable! Meredith, the antagonist is so ridiculously horrible to listen to. She must have no life, as all she ever does in the movie is try to make sure the school stays separated. It's like she has nothing better to do! Her super sweet 16 party is ridiculous, the song she sings is ear bleedingly bad, and her cronies are clichéd from bad kiddie cartoons. The main four girls are harmless characters, but they have such bad lines they become unlikeable quickly also. They almost act like they're five years old in their purity. Then there's the creeper character, Yasmin's little brother Manny (William May). He's supposed to be in high school, but he keeps hitting on Meredith's eight to ten year old sister. In a couple years this guy'll be asking for it when he gets sent off to prison.<br/><br/>The worst part of the movie are the lines. There is not a single interesting thing said by these characters, and almost every line is a horrible and corny line. The fact that a character says \"I've got the passion for fashion.\" is enough to shut this garbage off and throw the tainted TV in the trash. But it doesn't stop there. Most of the conversations here go back to my previously stated commercial comment. These conversations sound like one's from bad deodorant commercials or something.<br/><br/>This is just a horrible kids film. It will only appeal to little girls. Anyone else who enjoys it, well more power to them. For me, this is complete and utter rubbish.<br/><br/>My rating: BOMB out of ****. 100 mins.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Four lifelong friends Cloe (Skyler Shaye), Yasmin (Nathalia Ramos), Sasha (Logan Browning), and Jade (Janel Parrish) are about to start their freshman year at Carry Nation High School. Student Body President, Meredith Baxter Dimley (Chelsea Staub), daughter of Principal Dimley (Jon Voight) maintains order in the school by assigning all incoming students to Cliques. This includes Cloe, Yasmin, Sasha, and Jade who all find their friendship tested by the oppressive social structure.<br/><br/>Launched in 2001, the Bratz doll line while slow to start eventually became a major competitor against the de facto monopoly of Barbie capturing nearly 40% of the doll market. The doll line was subject to both criticism and praise with some applauding the ethnic diversity of the line in contrast to Barbie, while others were quick to interpret the attire, attitudes, and other facets of the line as promoting sexualization and promiscuity. Most of the criticism was written off and had no major effect on the line's success, and what hiatuses happened were mostly the result of legal actions by Barbie owner Mattel. In 2006, Avi Arad fresh from his resignation at Marvel Studios before the MCU took off, acquired the rights to Bratz to make a feature film based on the property helmed by low budget children's film director Sean McNamara and produced by Jon Voight and Steven Paul's production company Crystal Sky Pictures best known for production on the Baby Geniuses movies. The film was a massive failure critically and commercially and was even nominated for worst picture at the Golden Raspberry Awards only being beat out by I Know Who Killed Me, the Razzies made a mistake because as bad as I Know Who Killed Me may have been, it at least feels like a movie as opposed to Bratz.<br/><br/>From the point the movie opens, the titular \"Bratz\" are pretty much interchangeable in terms of personality and really only distinguished by their wardrobes which are the subject of a number of montage scenes (which makes sense given the movie is based on dolls) and for the most part talk, act, and behave pretty similarly to one another. On occasion you'll get some cringey humor based on antiquated stereotypes such as Yasmin's homelife where it's basically bludgeoned into the audience she's of Hispanic heritage down to not only is her home filled with people, it also has a Mariachi Band in it....you read that correctly, and there's other instances just like this for the other characters. Things aren't much better once we get to Carry Nation High School (because kids love Prohibition/Temperance references?) where the student body is made up of broad caricatures that make up the \"cliques\" with your typical jocks, geeks, loners, and odd ones like \"kids who dress up like dinosaurs\". On occasion there's maybe an inspired gag such as a scene where Principal Dimley is reading a book called \"How to Run a Prison\" but it's so suffocated by the weight of the movie and its lack of subtlety that it barely registers.<br/><br/>Then we have the underlying crux of the movie of \"being yourself\", \"don't let the world define you\", and etc. Which is a worthwhile enough message but A) it rings pretty hollow when you're utilizing broad stereotypes and caricatures and B) The movie spends so much time focusing on the titular Bratz \"fashionizing\" and \"accessorizing\" themselves it's comes off like lip service trying to disguise how superficial the whole thing comes off as. The 2004 film Meangirls handled this material much better, but that movie was written by Tina Fey and carried a PG-13 rating which allowed it to tackle the High School experience with more edge and wit. The movie is written by credited writer Susan Estelle Jansen (though initial uncredited work was done by Susie Singer Carter) and while Jansen has a successful history as a producer on the Lizzie McGuire series and even wrote the finale film, the writing of that series skewed younger and focused on Junior High students and a very polished version of Junior High at that. While there have been some movies that take place in High School that are PG, they typically play up the camp value or silliness because it's very difficult to address teenage issues in a \"family friendly manner\", and Bratz seemingly wants to be both a fluff piece and a friendship story and doesn't have the ability to pull off either one.<br/><br/>Bratz is a soulless product that looks, feels, and plays like a feature length commercial. From bland interchangeable protagonists, to over the top style and performances, to high school satire that's about as cutting as baby teeth, Bratz is just as plastic and artificial as the products it bases itself upon.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">It's been a weird day. My air conditioner went belly up and I sought refuge from the 100+ degree heat at my local mega-multi-plex, buying a ticket to the \"Bourne movie\". After 20 minutes of that movie's self-conscious unsteady-cam filming technique I was feeling a little queasy and bailed. Stopping at \"Bratz\" to recover my equilibrium before seeking a refund and an airsickness bag. What I saw was a totally empty theater (zero people) just two weeks after the movie's release.<br/><br/>I couldn't find much similarity between the teen actresses and the dolls (the dolls are all a lot cuter). What strikes me as interesting is not the content of the movie but the fact that it was given a wide theatrical release. The inventory of films must be pretty low if they have to send this anywhere but direct to video. <br/><br/>As already pointed out this is \"the single most shallow, insignificant, poorly-directed, badly- acted movie of this year\", or maybe any year. It also has about the narrowest target audience possible for a mainstream film, 3 to 9 year old girls with an infatuation with clothes, shoes, hair, and make-up. They must be serious girly-girls, your soccer and softball playing daughters won't find anything to relate to here. <br/><br/>But I'm not sure if the complaints about the message behind the film are really valid. It revolves around four multi-ethnic BFF teen girls who have nothing in common except their fashion trend value systems. Now this would be bad if the characters were played by beautiful young actresses in a school full of gorgeous likewise beautiful girls with perfect bodies. Which is what you expect from the standard pre-sold teen movie. But instead Yasmin (Natalie Ramos), Jade (Janel Parish), Sasha (Logan Browning), and Chloe (Skyler Shaye) look ready to pledge a dogs, pigs, and elephants sorority. For a while I thought I was watching an episode of \"Animal Planet\". Meredith (Chelsea Staub) was a pleasant exception in this school's bovine to canine parade.<br/><br/>They look more like four homely college freshman than hot high school fashion types and the student body looks just as bland. Whatever happened to the days when starlets got parts based strictly on their beauty with their acting skills irrelevant? Of course acting skills were just as irrelevant in these casting choices. Which leads to the obvious question of how a group of people so average looking and so clueless about the thespian profession happened to all wonder onto the set of this movie looking dazed and confused. The point being that no little girl is going to get an inferiority complex or suffer from an eating disorder because of watching this movie. The producers have unintentionally managed the positive message that no amount of expensive clothes, shoes, hair, and make- up can make an average girl look like a hot teen actress.<br/><br/>Speaking of wandering on to the set looking dazed and confused, Jon Voight plays Meredith's father and the school principal. Now I realize that the highlight of Voight's recent career is a \"Seinfeld\" cameo and his teeth marks on a pencil, but appearing in this mess is the equivalent of Bela Lugosi working with Ed Wood in the 1950's to support his drug habit.<br/><br/>The movie concludes with a loud and irritating musical number which I suspect was inspired by the success of \"High School Musical\". <br/><br/>Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</div>\n",

I normally don't comment on films I haven't seen all the way through, but since I currently work in a cinema and have had to endure snippets of this rubbish for the last couple of days I feel I have seen more than enough to comment on it.<br/><br/>First off...walking through the auditorium doors at any point during this \"movie\" is like being battered repeatedly about the head by a deranged thug wielding a piece of two-by-four. You can literally feel your conscious mind sagging in defeat as the dreadful mindlessness of it washes over you. It really is a palpable thing.<br/><br/>At no point that I saw did any of the lead girls display anything remotely like acting ability. They can't even be referred to as wooden, since the term \"wooden actor\" at least implies some ability, however dismal.<br/><br/>All that this movie offers is the most pitifully superficial gratification for the absolute youngest girls. And all the movie seems to teach is that being superficial and shallow is the best way to \"get on\" in life.<br/><br/>And what the heck is John Voight doing in here? At what point was he convinced that doing a teen movie based on a set of ugly, under-dressed and over made-up dolls was a good career move? I really pity people with small daughters...this movie must be the worst kind of hell for them. Parents....you have my commiserations.<br/><br/>SUMMARY: Plot - Ronald McDonald, Acting - None, Entertainment - You'll be REAL happy when its over.</div>\n",

As for the doll line, I am more of Barbie girl myself...Yes! I am 22 years and I still collected Barbie dolls. I only love the TV show and the new live-action film that came out last summer. As I said a million times, I was shocked, surprised and flabbergasted by the negative reviews I would see on the web. I thought the film was an excellent comedy.<br/><br/>I love the idea of friendship, though many people find it corny but I love the idea as the girls Yasmin, Sasha, Chloe and Jade face during their first year of high school. I had like films and shows that set in high school ever since I was in the 8th Grade. I love it when Meredith shouts \"You Brats!!\" It's like the film's title would spring out of her mouth. And I also love the big show the Bratz put on at the school talent show, it was awesome!</div>\n",

I don't know if this movie was meant to be taken seriously? I laughed throughout the whole thing because of how ridiculous it was! The actresses are terrible along with the songs they sing. Yasmin's singing voice is so off that I died. Not to mention Sasha's too. Jade was the only who could actually sing. And the choreography is so bad that the girls look unattractive.\n",
      "I think the girls were awful influences on young girls. They wear way too much makeup for young high schoolers. Plus, Yasmin is absolutely terrible to Dylan. In the words of Yasmin, \"You don't sound deaf.\" There was so much wrong with that whole situation.\n",
      "Another bad thing was how cliché the whole plot and characters were. The mean/rich girl, the jock, the cute boy, the annoying friends, the sports girl, the cheerleader, the shy girl who has an 'amazing voice', and the smart girl who has a, \"passion for fashion.\"\n",

John Voight, has, up to this point, belittled himself to the detriment of himself...literally. What actor would star in this? Is it for the money or to push up against these \"beampoles\"? The main idea of this film is image, just what perception of image as laid out in this film is anyone's judgement.<br/><br/>Little kids or fans of these \"Urban Barbies\" may like this film for its \"merit\" but only from a kid's point of view. Adults, please take heed and do your best to try and wipe this film's existence from your mind. Like Morpheus said to Neo in the Matrix: Free your mind.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Every year, there are movies that look utterly horrible and actually ARE utterly horrible. But every now and then, a movie comes along that you are expecting to be so bad, so terrible, that you are ready to hate it before you see itwhen you do you are strangely surprised that the movie isn't all that bad, and it was actually kind of good. Every year has its surprises. Borat was last year's big surprise, and this year had three big surprises that came out on the same day: Underdog, Hot Rod, and Bratz. Yes, let me get it out of my system now. Bratz, the movie I was going to love hating, really wasn't all that bad. The previews promised torture to the viewers who were unfortunate enough to watch it, and I went to see it because I needed another god-awful film to dethrone Napoleon Dynamite as the worst movie of all time. But Bratz, a fun teen flick with lots of heart, strangely won me over about an hour in. It did the opposite of what I was expecting around almost every bend (although there is still that typical cliché ending that everyone will expect from this sort of movie). Bratz features four relatively new actresses in the lead roles; Logan Browning plays Sasha, Janel Parrish plays Jade, Nathalia Ramos plays Yasmin, and Skyler Shaye plays Cloe. John Voight is also in a small role playing the principal of the high school.<br/><br/>Sasha, Jade, Yasmin, and Cloe have always been the very best of friends, and they don't expect high school to be any different. Scheming, spoiled, snobby, little-miss-perfect prep girl Meredith, however, thinks otherwise. She is the president of the student body, and she makes her presence more than knownall of the new kids must come to her so that she can sort them in with their associated cliques. No one is allowed to make friends outside of the cliques basically. When the girls arrive, however, Meredith begins to fear that there could be trouble. In their freshmen year, however, the girls blend in with their own assorted cliques; Jade hangs with the science nerds, Yasmin hangs with the cheerleaders, Cloe becomes a preppy jock, and Yasmin is pretty much left by herself. As time goes on, the girls begin to drift farther and farther apart from each other until two years pass, and they are pretty much little more than acquaintances. Through a series of events, they decide that they need to be friends again, and they cannot let the situation with the cliques get in the way of their friendship. Meredith is pretty much appalled as she watched the world she created crumble beneath her, so she sets out to teach the 'Bratz' some lessons.<br/><br/>I am actually kind of embarrassed to say that I liked this movie. It did, after all, teach some very good life lessons, it had really good songs, and some of the actors were halfway decent. Clearly the best among the bunch were Janel Parrish and Nathalia Ramos, who play Jade and Yasmin, respectively. They gave their characters life and they had loads of fun with their roles. Chelsea Staub, who played Meredith, seemed like she was having lots of fun, but she wasn't the best actress in the world. Also somewhere in the middle of the acting spectrum was Skyler Shaye, who played Cloe. While she did bring a unique personality to the character, she was very weak at times, but she was mostly tolerable, and I loved her character to death. The very worst by far in terms of acting had to be Logan Browning, who played Sasha. She was absolutely horrendous in nearly all of her scenes, although there were a couple where she showed a bit of promise. Very close behind in terms of the awful acting was the young actor who played Yasmin's little brother. He showed no skill at all, his lines were always forced and never subtle, and he always seemed devoid of any sort of emotion or energy. The supporting cast was all pretty decent, including the parents of all the girls and the all of the boys.<br/><br/>As stated previously, the musical numbers were all handled very well. While I couldn't stay during the credits because I had to work, I did love every song and I liked the directing very much. There were so many bright colors and funny moments scattered throughout the movie that I couldn't help but smile. This is another feel-good film the whole family can enjoy.<br/><br/>As much as there are positive things to say about Bratz, there were many negatives. Before the 'two years later' sequence occurred, the movie showed no promise at all. I almost got up and walked right out because it was delivering exactly what the preview had promised. The script for the introduction to the characters as well as the opening scene were very poorly written, and basically all of the actresses delivered their lines like robots. For some reason, though, once it hit the half hour point, things got considerably better and it actually seemed as if it was molding itself out into an actual movie as it progressed. By the end, everything was actually coherent and very enjoyable. In many scenes, the acting became a major issue and annoyed me to no end. Still, Bratz definitely had its moments where I actually saw a great movie shining through. It was very cliché in some aspects, but in many others it tried something new and most often succeeded.<br/><br/>Bratz the Movie was full twists and turn, surprises and songs, good acting and horrendous acting. I liked the characters a lot, and the movie itself actually managed to be halfway decent. I was expecting this to be utterly terrible, but it surprised me in every category. Still, the movie is not without its share of flaws and it is far from perfect. 6/10</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">\"Bratz\" leaves it's audience at a loss for words, wondering what kind of weird dimension they walked into. Every character could be described as one dimensional if you felt like being generous, the plot is just utter nonsense and everyone in the film looks like they wish they had invested their money better so they wouldn't have to be on screen. I know some people would argue that my standards for what a movie can be should have been lowered when I came across this live-action film based on a series of dolls, but aren't little girls people too? Don't they deserve the same kind of respect for their intelligence that everyone else does? None of the characters have any personalities besides whatever accessories their toys come with (so for example, there's a sporty one, a smart sciency one, a cheerleader and if I remember correctly... the last one is just clumsy) and it becomes almost offensive how broad the comedy is. This might just be John Voigt's worst movie. Yeah he's been in some real stinkers like \"Anaconda\", \"Baby Geniuses 2\" and \"Karate Dog\" but in how many other pictures can you see him with a goofy prosthetic nose while playing a bumbling comedic principal? I have this movie at home because I collect bad movies and this is one of those that's so bad you have to see it to believe it. (Dvd, January 6, 2012)</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">It's very difficult to write a long review for this film because there isn't much in it to talk about. Bratz was on the bottom 100 when it was on the cinemas but still has a very low rating, which is fair enough. It had a very simple story that wasn't even told very well and I only understood it by reading it on paper not on screenplay. It was boring with many daft scenes like when one of the four girls was changing her clothes while the other three were covering her. Probably it is specifically made for girls but my sister didn't even like it although she is a huge Bratz fan. The movie was quite bad throughout but the ending was good &amp; saved it and that's why I'm giving it a 2 out of 10. I can't say that it is the worst movie ever because no film can be worse than Pulp Fiction and Jackass part 1 &amp; 2. The food fight scene was creative at start then was very funny. Most users either gave it a 1 or 9 out of 10, which means that you can either really hate it or love it but 10/10 means perfect, which definitely isn't. Overall I didn't like the film but I absolutely did not hate it as well because it did not bore me to death and I have seen much worse films.</div>\n",

Well, my answer: Pretty darn bad. Soo...these four girls are best friends, and always have annoying smiles on their faces and are way too upbeat. Really annoying stuff. And when they get to high school, they find other friends, and kind of all split up. OMG! (Oh, and \"OMG\" is an actual line in the movie too). I guess you can't have more than a four friends in school, according to this movie. Oh yeah, and there is this class president bimbo who wants to keep all the girls separated by groups or something. Well, the years pass, and by senior year, the girls suddenly think...why aren't we friends again? Soo...they dump(!) their new friends, and all get back together! WOW! And when one girl doesn't have new clothes for a party, the other magically gets a gift certificate to the mall! And that party is throne by the evil bimbo! WOW! I wish I could pull an FYE gift card out of my butt! And why would you want to go to a party that exploits your friends? And the girls call themselves \"Bratz\" which kind of just sounds like they are insulting themselves. And all the girls are skinny and perfect looking, because the good girls in the movies always have to look perfect! I just can't think about this movie without hurling. Stay away. And John Voight, I lost my respect.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">\"Bratz\" is not just the most atrocious film this year but it's a horrifying indictment of obnoxious American teenage narcissism. While I fully understand that I'm clearly 'like soooo' not in their demographic (sticking out like a sore thumb in the process, flanked by a handful of empty seats) but what is plainly opposable is its toxic value system that prioritises superficiality and pop music over its sledgehammer lessons of friendships and inclusiveness. Sprung from a line of fashion dolls that make Barbie look like an Amish housewife, the film tones down its creepy sexualised tone for quickie moral lessons and puerile considerations of racial identities.<br/><br/>These Bratz consist of freshmen high schoolers in Hispanic Yasmin (Nathalia Ramos), African-American Sasha (Logan Browning), Caucasian Cloe (Skyler Shaye) and Pan-Asian Jade (Janel Parrish). Preaching individualism through materialism and in a haze of noxiously pandering stereotypes (Yasmin's represented through food and music, Sasha teaches everyone a thing or two about dancing, Cloe's a pretty go-getter at soccer and Jade's a science whiz under all that face-paint!), the thing that's even more egregious is its condescension of young femininity under the guise of appreciating the gender. Considering its impressionable core audience, it commits such a cinematic sin when it is caught attempting to traffic in post-feminism while at the same time, disparaging it completely.<br/><br/>Consciously cavalier and ironically insular, its entirely manufactured theme of abolishing cliques and embracing individuality is a tougher merchandise to flog than the titular skanky dolls when all it ends up affirming is the sorry state of materialism that is allowed to pervade even the most tenuous of idealisms. \"Bratz\", while never once approaching the subversion of \"Mean Girls\", would have been a fantastic satire if they had proceeded to cast the chasms of mainstream pop culture like Paris Hilton, Nicole Richie, Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan, that and if it wasn't so hands-over-eyes blind about its consumerist schlock peddling.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Had I not been forced to see this film because of my occupation (and the fact I have two young daughters), I would have avoided this particular production like Richard Simmons avoids women.<br/><br/>However, no such luck came my way on this night, and I was subjected to one of the single most shallow, insignificant, poorly-directed, badly-acted movies of the year.<br/><br/>Or in ANY year, for that matter.<br/><br/>\"Bratz, The Movie\" is supposedly based on those slutty-looking dolls with huge eyes, full lips and no noses; figures which many parents feel imbues their daughters with an overinflated infatuation with clothes, shoes and make-up. Unfortunately, this movie is live action (but still concentrates on the whole \"appearance is the most important\" thing).<br/><br/>And while the film tries to touch on friendships being key, the main message here is that only thin, good-looking people are worth anything; and the only way to make a difference in the world is to wear the latest, most expensive fashions.<br/><br/>As if any of this makes any difference, here's the basic plot outline: Four adolescent girls (all beautiful with perfect bodies), Yasmin (Natalie Ramos), Jade (Janel Parish), Sasha (Logan Browning) and Chloe (Skyler Shaye) enter high school. It's also needless to mention that none of these young women has even the most remote acting talents, whatsoever.<br/><br/>In fact, I've seen better acting in a morgue. Friends, the combined talent of the entire cast and crew of \"Bratz\" could be put in a thimble and there would still be room for Rosie O'Donnell's butt.<br/><br/>But I digress ...<br/><br/>Anyway, these four vapid souls enter Carrie A. Nation High School (which is more than appropriate since I wanted to take a hatchet to the projection room during this preview) and immediately clash with uptight beauty queen, Meredith (Chelsea Staub) and her group of \"Heathers\" wannabes.<br/><br/>Meredith - even though a freshman - has divided the entire academy into clicks (emo's, skaters, geeks, potheads, jocks, tree-huggers and other assorted losers). Why anyone accepts this pigeon-holing is beyond me, but wondering about this isn't worth the time it takes for a synapse to fire, so ...<br/><br/>And while it's easy to see the above-mentioned no-names populating this production, it's quite disheartening to watch a veteran actor such as Jon Voight, who plays Meredith's father and school principal. He not only embarrasses himself in the movie, but has put a stamp of incompetence on what was once a stellar career.<br/><br/>Oh, there's also a deaf kid, Dylan (Ian Nelson) who somehow has the power to hear Yasmin singing (oh, and he can spin turntables, as well).<br/><br/>The picture's witless conclusion consists of a huge birthday bash for Meredith (see enters on an elephant) and a loud and irritating musical number (it's amazing what passes for entertainment in today's world).<br/><br/>My little girls liked this film, but then again they are 3 and 7-years old. Unless you fit into this particular gender or age group - or are in a coma - you will see this entire enterprise as shallow as a saucer and empty-headed as Paris Hilton.<br/><br/>Truly one of the worst movie-going experiences since \"Are We Done Yet?\"</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">When I was younger, I liked Bratz, to be more specific, their Babyz versions. I also remember watching the Bratz Babyz movie and loving it. However, today I'll be talking about their live action theatrical debut simply called Bratz. It's one of the lowest rated movies along with the Emoji movie (I don't hate that movie either) and for some reason I thought it was alright, nothing spectacular or extraordinary but it's fine.<br/><br/>The movie starts with our quartet: Yasmin (Nathalie Ramos), Cloe (Skyler Shae), Sasha (Logan Browning) and Jade (Janel Parrish) going to college and being best friends forever! However, one person in particular Meredith (Chelsea Stubb) is a perfectionist daughter of the principal who wants to sort our main girls into clubs, thus separating them.<br/><br/>But our main characters will still be together no matter what and that annoys the antagonist so much, that she will do anything to humiliate them.<br/><br/>Well, the whole setting reminds me of Disney channel's High school musical, even the villain is too similar to Sharpay by being a spoiled rich girl with a puppy in her purse. However, the whole musical aspect happens in the end with the talent competition. The story is ok, but can be a little weird sometimes. Like in one scene the whole school makes a food fight simply because a puppy pulled Cloe's leg and she dropped her lunch on Jade and then the whole college throws food on each other with classical music on the background.<br/><br/>Speaking of songs, they were pretty good, especially \"it's all about me\" and \"Brattiude\". Sure, they are not as good as songs in Bratz Babyz (these songs were awesome), but both singers and composers did try their best and are actually radio-worthy. The actresses were not that bad either, most of them are actually teenagers (with the exception of Skylar Shae, who played Cloe) and they act well. I also noticed that the movie talks about some issues like parental divorce, money issues, deaf students and the decision whether you should stick with your old friends or follow your passion. Sure, they are only briefly shown because of the fact that this is a movie for preteens, but the fact that it included such themes, makes this movie better than it should be. Of course, it's still has fashion and shopping moments like usually in Bratz movies, but it's not really the main focus and it still follows the plot about friendship.<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend this movie to girls of 8-12 years, high school musical fans and people who liked Bratz when they were younger. But it's not for Bratz haters, so if you are one, then it's better to skip this film.</div>\n",

I'm very close to my little cousin, and she looks up to me. i personally told her not to see the film because it would make her feel unpretty and stupid. i'm very glad she followed my advice. if you're a shallow low-life crackhead who thinks fashion and acting like a bitchy slut is what life is all about, then this movie is for you. i'm serious this movie is so bad, bad acting, stupid plot, and EXTREMELY ANNOYING CHARACTERS. 1/10</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Someone asked why have they made a picture focussing on Richard Williams and not his two daughters; Venus and Serena who are the ones that won so many grand slams.<br/><br/>The answer is that movie studios were not interested about Venus and Serena. A film about their father. A driven, complicated and obstinate showman managed to attract funding.<br/><br/>The problem with King Richard is that with the Williams sisters as producers of the movie. It is sugar coated and pulls its punches.<br/><br/>Richard Williams (Will Smith) wanted his daughters to succeed and he has written a plan for them to become top tennis players even before they were born.<br/><br/>Richard and his wife Brandy want to escape their neighbourhood in Compton. Richard gets regularly beaten up by gang members who pester his daughters. The well heeled white men in the tennis clubs are not interested in coaching his daughters. The sub text being that black people are more suited for the basketball court than the tennis court.<br/><br/>Richard is undeterred. When he does find a coach to train Venus for free. Brandy decides to train Serena as Richard interferes and falls out with the coach.<br/><br/>At times Richard claims to know better. He looks for better coaches and then falls out with them. He even pulls his daughters from the junior circuit because he wants his daughters to have a normal life and concentrate on their education. Despite them playing tennis since they were toddlers.<br/><br/>King Richard is part biopic and part plucky success against the odds story. Will Smith makes a good attempt to capture the contradictory nature of Richard Williams. The script though does not get down and dirty.<br/><br/>There is a scene where Richard and Brandy have an argument and tell some home truths. Richard has had children from other relationships which seemed to be affairs. Brandy had three daughters from a previous marriage. It needed to stick the knife into Richard Williams and brings out his flaws a lot more.<br/><br/>The coaches found Richard to be hard work. Finding out that he had his own agenda and ulterior motives. Instead the movie opts for sentimentality as Venus takes her first steps in the pro circuit.</div>\n",

So if you've seen other things he's done, you should be aware that he can act.<br/><br/>And if not, then this movie will make you aware of it. Not an easy character to play and surely quite weird for the Williams sisters to watch Will Smith being their dad ... but boy what a performance. Certain things are quite wild ... and I sometimes really wonder how he got away with a lot of things ... I reckon because of the plan ... well you'll understand when you watch the movie.<br/><br/>Or you already know - I wasn't aware of him as a public figure or as ... anything for that matter. Like everyone else I knew of the Williams sisters ... and I knew how good they are (or were, not even sure if they play anymore to be honest ... though one did while pregnant not long ago) ... as you can tell I am not following too much Tennis these days. But I know some of the players here ... and I recognized the names of certain people. Not the trainers ... you don't need to know anyone of course ... you can enjoy the drama of it all ... without being a fan of the sport itself.<br/><br/>Having said/written all that, the movie works on many levels. Do not expect to see all of the career that Venus and Serena had ... that may be material for another movie ... until then ... who knows, maybe an Academy Award for Mr. Will Smith?</div>\n",

Although I'm not into tennis, there was no denying their talent.<br/><br/>What I didn't know about was their life story. Reinaldo Marcus Green's \"King Richard\" looks at this, with Will Smith as their father, a man who gave tough love out of a desire for his children to have a better life than he had.<br/><br/>This is a great movie all around. Part of it is that it's good to see Smith taking serious roles (it was fun to see him play hip dudes, but he couldn't do that forever). Beyond that, every cast member puts in a fine performance, and it's lovable to see the whole story plain out. If you have any extra time, definitely see this one.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Now in their 40s the Williams sisters Venus and Serena have become what their dad predicted years ago, arguably the two best female tennis players ever. If you believe him, his plan started before they were born.<br/><br/>It is important to keep the title in mind, it is the Dad's story. Of course you can't tell the dad's story without a lot of focus on the sisters and this movie does. It focuses more on Venus and her professional start because she is the older of the two.<br/><br/>I well remember Richard Williams all those years ago, in his public persona he came across as a real jackass, and because of his personality it was hard to like him. But honestly, this is a superb movie, it shows a lot that none of us could have known. If this had been a fictional story it would be hard to accept. The movie is long, running almost 2 1/2 hours, but it is so well made that it never seemed long. Will Smith gives an award-worthy performance in the role.<br/><br/>My wife and I watched it at home on DVD from our public library. During the movie I wondered how the junior tennis was depicted so realistically and the 9-minute \"making of\" extra shows how they did. They used real champion caliber junior tennis players as tennis doubles and used face replacement technology to make it look like the young Venus and Serena actors were actually playing and hitting the shots.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Pretty boring biopic about the early days of tennis stardom for Venus and Serena Williams, focusing on the role their father played in their success.<br/><br/>If you read anything about the real person that Will Smith plays in this movie, you'll quickly understand how whitewashed it all is to make it more palatable and Oscar-baity. Well it worked, because lo and behold, here is \"King Richard\" among this year's slate of Best Picture nominees. Oh and look, there's Will Smith's name among the movie's producers. No wonder the character was whitewashed.<br/><br/>This hits every single mark you would expect it to, without a surprise or unpredictable moment within miles. The film's brightest spot is Aunjanue Ellis, as Smith's wife and mother to the Williams sisters. Every cookie cutter biopic about an overbearing, obsessive male must include a partner who suffers nobly and acts as the film's conscience, and Ellis gets that dubious job here. But she does quite well with it, and the movie sparkled a little bit more every time she was on the screen.<br/><br/>Tony Goldwyn and Jon Bernthal also stand out as two of the sisters' coaches.<br/><br/>Grade: B.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Greetings again from the darkness. Sports parents. Band parents. Dance parents. Cheerleader parents. Drama parents. We all know THOSE parents ... and many of us, whether we admit it or not, ARE those parents. Director Reinaldo Marcus Green (JOE BELL, 2020) and first time screenwriter Zach Baylin bring us the story of the unconventional, hard-driving, flawed, well-intentioned father of tennis superstars Venus and Serena Williams.<br/><br/>Will Smith portrays Richard Williams in a showcase role that he capitalizes on. Richard Williams is not a particularly likable man - his hustler mentality is eclipsed only by his stubbornness. But more than anything, Richard Williams was committed to giving Venus and Serena every opportunity to succeed in a tennis world that seemed like a different universe to the Compton neighborhood in which they were raised. Richard and his wife Oracene (an outstanding Aunjanue Ellis, THE HELP) coached the young girls themselves in public parks via instructional articles in Tennis magazines. Both parents balanced their jobs with this coaching, and Richard spent a significant amount of time \"marketing\" the girls to professional coaches, most who had no interest in taking on pupils who couldn't pay.<br/><br/>Venus (Saniyya Sidney) and younger sister Serena (Demi Singleton) trust whole-heartedly in \"The Plan\" their father has in place. It's a plan designed to place million dollar checks in their hands, and lead them to the top of the tennis world. Their first break comes in the form of John McEnroe coach Paul Cohen (Tony Goldwyn), who agrees to coach Venus. The real fun begins when Richard cuts a deal with super coach/trainer Rick Macci (a terrific Jon Bernthal) to take on both girls and cover the families living arrangements in Florida.<br/><br/>What makes this film work is that so many of us can relate to just how difficult it is to be a parent, and never settle for less when it comes to the kids. Now, Richard Williams is an extreme example - and his enormously successful daughters have dealt his approach a hand of credibility. Richard and Oracene are presented as very protective of their daughters, but also obsessed with helping them excel at school, tennis, and life. Given that there are three other daughters living in the house, it's surprising that we don't get more details on the reactions from those girls to the favorable treatment of Venus and Serena. The family is presented as being very tight-knit and loving, but it's difficult to swallow that jealousy didn't rise up periodically.<br/><br/>This truly is the story of how Richard Williams remained focused on getting his daughters to the top, so don't expect the tennis history of Venus and Serena. The young actors playing them are excellent, but this takes us through the foundation of their careers while overcoming adversity, not the professional highlights. Oscar winning cinematographer Robert Elswit (THERE WILL BE BLOOD) makes the tennis look legitimate, while also bringing us the family intimacy. In fact, the scene in the kitchen is one of the more intense and well-acted scenes we will see this year, and the camera work amplifies the tension. On the lighter side, we get Will Smith singing Kenny Rogers' \"The Gambler\", and the closing credits show actual clips of Richard, Venus and Serena, as well as a rundown of their impressive achievements. Director Green has delivered a crowd-pleaser with some poignancy and a few well-placed messages. It wouldn't surprise to see a few award nominations attached to this one.<br/><br/>Opens in theaters and streams on HBO Max beginning November 19, 2021.</div>\n",

The movie is a fine and for sure a well done family mentor type story of how father Richard Williams(in a bold turn from Will Smith) coached and guided little daughters Venus and Serena into world class pro tennis champs. From the family tough start in Compton, California Richard is determined to start his daughters young with practice on the local courts. Richard does all of this guiding with love and support while teaching his daughters education and being humble. The journey then leads the Williams family to Florida for world class training. Thru it all it's Richard's way or the highway as he's stubborn, tough, while wanting success for his girls really Richard was a loving parent. Overall good well done film of family and love, not so much a watch for tennis it's really a showcase of father like help and guidance as Will Smith gives one of his best performances too.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">\"Venus and Serena gon' shake up this world.\" Richard Williams (Will Smith)<br/><br/>We know they shake it up plenty as they become the premiere tennis players in the world, the products partly of their father's ambition for them and his unorthodox approach to coaching. Yet, tennis in not the real subject of this charming biopic; it is about parenting skills that pay off and an actor who has the finest role of his successful career.<br/><br/>Will Smith does what I hoped he would-act believably the role of Richard Williams, infamous, overbearing father, rude, brash, and loving and insightful. Although at a point or two Smith pushes the accent far beyond what the end credits show of the real Richard's, he maintains our respect for his accomplishments and his wife's, Brandy (Aunjanue Ellis), both for bringing up model citizens and champions.<br/><br/>Richard had a vision for his two prodigies, even before they were born; King Richard shows the cost of that dream as they relentlessly practice, remain first academically in their classes, and have Richard ignore them when decisions are made. The film is expert at showing the dimensions of parenting, both the good and the bad.<br/><br/>The film also comments on the currently-popular topic of \"burnout,\" about which Richard is adamant he won't let happen as the vulture promoters begin offering millions for Venus (Saniyya Sidney) and eventually Serena (Demi Singleton) but with overwhelming obligations that could cut in to school or bring on drugs.<br/><br/>Although the story is well-known and follows a standard sports formula, director Reinaldo Marcus Green and writer Zach Baylin\n",
      "keep it fast moving and realistic by playing to the characters rather than the competitions. The filmmakers, however, have an extended scene of Venus playing the world's top seed that is a tense and as exciting as any other I have seen.<br/><br/>Richard is a complex father who gives love through coaching and encouraging study and prayer for his daughters (he has five). On the other hand, he doesn't always listen to his daughters or his wife, is irascible and at a few times, irrational. Yet because he loves deeply and sincerely and doesn't always let his ego get in the way, King Richard becomes a story of respect for family and determination to be the best in the world. And maybe the best actor?</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Chronicling the rise of two of the greatest sportswomen to ever step on the tennis court, King Richard covers the life of Richard Williams who in his determination to engrave his daughters' names in the history books not only coached them from early age but also instilled them with characteristics that paved the path for both Venus &amp; Serena Williams to become the legends of the sport.<br/><br/>Directed by Reinaldo Marcus Green, the story serves as a feel-good biopic with a big shot of inspiration and despite some obvious shortcomings, it manages to deliver the desired goods. While Green does well to keep things riveting and provides a flawed yet fascinating sketch of its titular character &amp; Williams family as a whole, the sporting segments do lack the required finesse and are poorly filmed.<br/><br/>Deftly navigating through race, class, family, sport &amp; more, the story never loses its dramatic weight and the fleshed-out characters help keep us invested in the proceedings. Also helping the cause is its committed cast that render their real-life figures on screen with welcome sincerity. Will Smith gets to work on the acting muscles that haven't seen much action in a while and is brilliant throughout. And the rest are just as compelling.<br/><br/>Overall, King Richard is a finely crafted, skilfully narrated &amp; outstandingly acted biographical drama that comes equipped with all the ingredients that goes into curating a crowd-pleasing delight. What prevents it from soaring to the heights of its genre's finest offerings however is its overlong runtime &amp; the action that unfolds on the tennis court as it fails to create the nail-biting tension &amp; restless excitement that's expected from a sport film. Definitely worth a shot.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>\"King Richard\" (2021) is a very good movie about sisters Williams. And their father Richard. Its told its more or less from a point of Richard, excellently played by Will Smith. Yet i don't think its his best performance ever nor it is the best of the year - but its good for sure. \"King Richard\" is also a safe biopic so to speak - it does not reinvent the wheel or anything, yet its a interesting story well told. Directing, writing, cinematography and acting by everyone involved were superb. Also it always pays off to have the invaluable Jon Bernthal in a cast - he delivers as usually only goods.<br/><br/>Overall, at running time 2 h 20 min \"King Richard\" was excellently paced movie - it never dragged for i was bored. I liked the story and how well it was made. Good movie on all accounts.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">\"King Richard\" is a Biography - Sport movie in which we watch the life story of tennis superstars Venus and Serena Williams from the beginnings and how important their father and coach Richard Williams was on their careers.<br/><br/>First of all, I have to mention that I will review the movie and what I watched, not the potential differences that this movie had with real life events if there was any. I enjoyed it because it is based on two simply legendary tennis players who changed tennis for ever. The direction which was made by Reinaldo Marcus Green was very good and I liked the way he presented the life of the Williams family, the struggle, the pressure and how difficult it was everything in the start. The interpretation of both Will Smith who played as Richard Williams and Aunjanue Ellis who played as Oracene 'Brandy' Williams were outstanding and their combination worked very well. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Saniyya Sidney's who played as Venus Williams, Demi Singleton who played as Serena Williams and Jon Bernthal who played as Rick Macci. In conclusion, I have to say that \"King Richard\" is an amazing movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it because I am sure everyone can gain something by watching it.</div>\n",

Its a film that rolls with a big smile, and a tremendous success.<br/><br/>Even though the film mostly shows the up, and not the worst of hardships on the way, its decent and should inspire other kids from other unlikely set neighbourhoods to become super stars in whatever sport. Will smith as the father is a winner, but most of all the junior actors in this film amazes me, they do know how to play tennis, and they do know how to act, therefore a hi five to them and the cast.<br/><br/>Its not a highly original plot and setup for a sportsmovie, but its filled with love and humbleness, lots of humour, but also dominating parents that may be disliked by some, like me the grumpy old man, but its a romp worth to watch for the great tennis acts and sky high spirits.</div>\n",

And making this film one heartfelt story about Richard Williams (Will Smith) who is raising his two daughters Venus (Saniyya Sidney) and Serena (Demi Singleton) and plotting a life course of a successful professional tennis player path.<br/><br/>What Worked? It is a strong and heartfelt story. Richard plotting a path for his two daughters to become professional tennis players. It is strong. Richard is brilliant and stubborn. He even rejects professional tennis coach offers cause he felt like they were not right for his daughters. Which is a huge risk rejection. Of course things fall into place when he comes across Rick (Jon Bernthal). The story is good.<br/><br/>Will Smith delivers with another outstanding performance. Which he is a good actor. When he is on screen as Richard, he literally displays a whole different character on screen. Saniyya Sidney and Demi Singleton were both great with there characters. Aunjanue Ellis playing Brandy, there mother was also good. Jon Bernthal playing Rick who tries to lead the girl in a right path as a coach was also good.<br/><br/>What did not work? I felt like the film does have a little uneven pacing with its direction.<br/><br/>Overall, it is one strong emotional heartfelt story that will shine of seeing two rising tennis players becoming the famous players today.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Richard Williams--father of tennis phenoms Venus &amp; Serena--was one of the most controversial figures in the history of the sport. Denigrated as eccentric and overly protective, he also produced perhaps the two greatest female tennis stars of all time. \"King Richard\" digs into the mindset of the elder Williams to find some interesting material, though perhaps a bit filtered through Williams family approval of the entire project.<br/><br/>For a very basic overview, this film tells the story of Richard (Will Smith) raising his daughters in Compton--an area much more likely to produce gang-bangers than professional athletes. Though his handling of Venus (Saniyya Sidney) &amp; Serena (Demi Singleton) draws the ire of neighbors, coaches, endorsers, and even wife Oracene (Aunjanue Ellis), Richard is persistent that his \"plan\" is the only way to prevent the girls from burning out early and not reaching their true potential.<br/><br/>When Will Smith really commits and is heavily involved in a project, the result is usual of a high quality. That is exactly the case here, what with Smith often carrying \"King Richard\" for large stretches. He absolutely makes the character his own, expertly portraying Richard's idiosyncrasies while still maintaining his usual charm and wit. Without an actor of his caliber, this whole film falls apart.<br/><br/>Thematically, \"King Richard\" also delves into some very interesting material such as Richard's own history of racial persecution, his desire for his daughters (all of them--not just the athletes) to improve their life standing, and his persistence in the face of \"temptations\" such as easy paths to fame and lucrative endorsements before anything has really been \"earned\". Though very clearly slanted in such a fashion that Richard will never really be wrong in the end, director Reinaldo Marcus Green &amp; writer Zach Baylin do a fine job of showing at least some of his warts.<br/><br/>Truth be told, the only reason I limit my star ranking here to 8 is because of the amount of time spent on the actual tennis (from Venus &amp; Serena) in the film. I completely understand that decision to open the film to much wider audiences, but to me the material on Richard himself (most notably his background) was so interesting that the tennis scenes--especially one prolonged sequence--sort of took me out of the flow, as expertly crafted as they may have been. In short, I was looking for a 100% deep dive into Richard's psyche, and this movie gave me about 70%.<br/><br/>My overall take on \"King Richard\" is that it is both a solid &amp; entertaining biopic, if one that pulls its punches a bit and can't help itself in feeling the need to feature the Venus &amp; Serena characters prominently. But the sheer magnetism of Will Smith--which should garner him some award nominations at the very least--and the emotional depth that the themes sometimes touch on make it a fine addition to the sports biopic canon.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Film itself may not be a revelatory grand slam but upcoming director Reinaldo Marcus Green's true life tale of the start up years of future tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams under the planned guidance of their larger than life father Richard is the very definition of a feel good movie, that arguably holds its main star Will Smith's best chances yet at securing that Oscar his been so desperately chasing since he donned the gloves of Muhammad Ali way back in 2001.<br/><br/>An intimate drama that is content in allowing its characters to remain the centre court focus, King Richard never goes for full Hollywood sweeping biopic as Green lets Smith chew scenery in bun hugging shorts, high socks and grey speckled beard as his Richard and young stars Saniyya Sidney and Demi Singleton get to shine in what is a star making turn for the young Sidney in a tale that is much more Venus-centric than Serena.<br/><br/>The chemistry between these two performers and the ever reliable Smith is the heart and soul of this almost unbelievable true story and Green gets maximum millage out of his lead trio, with the bonus of yet another scene stealing Jon Bernthal as the girls eventual tennis coach Rick Macci, as the talented actor continues to stake his claim as one of the most dependable actors operating at this present time, and it's a joy to see Smith in such a winning mode once more after a few years of so-so outings and mismanaged performances.<br/><br/>Likely to go toe to toe with his turns in the Pursuit of Happyness and I am Legend in the battle of the public domain when it comes to favourite Will Smith movie performances, the talented actor looms large over the entire runtime of Green's film and whether his getting roughed up by Compton hoodlums, having extremely awkward flatulent infused meetings with high rollers or nervously watching his girls on the court, Smith embodies Williams in a stunning way and his work here is undoubtedly an ace.<br/><br/>Finely scripted by writer Zach Baylin and colourfully shot by the always finely attuned eye of cinematographer Robert Elswit, King Richard is an all round quality production that lacks that magic or spark that would've made it a future classic of the biography genre but it's a film that the whole family will enjoy and a worthy telling of an incredible story of two once in a lifetime athletes and their unique upbringing.<br/><br/>Final Say -<br/><br/>Lead by the best Will Smith performance in some time and featuring a star making turn from Saniyya Sidney, King Richard is a formulaic film of an anything but true story, making it a pleasant and well made Hollywood affair likely to become an all ages favourite in the year's to come.<br/><br/>3 1/2 nosy neighbours out of 5<br/><br/>For more reviews check out Jordan and Eddie.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">As \"King Richard\" (2021 release; 144 min.) opens, we are immediately in the thick of things as Richard Williams is a man with a plan, \"to go from protege to pro\" for his young daughters Venus and Serena who are budding tennis players. Alas, things are not as easy as they look, given that the Williams family is from Compton, CA and nobody in the tennis world is waiting on a black female tennis star (let alone two). But Richard perseveres... At this point we are 10 min into the film. You'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this is directed by Reinaldo Marcus Green (\"Monsters &amp; Men\"). More importantly, the Williams family gave its full blessing to this film, and Venus and Serena are both credited as Executive Producers. The script focuses very much on the complicated figure that is Richard Williams. Is he the well-meaning father who just wants his girls to succeed, at any cost? Or is he a self-promoting grand schemer? What if he is both of those, and more? The script dives deep into this character, and that is the ultimate reason why this film is so surprisingly effective. Because we know how this will end (spoiler: both Venus and Serena will conquer the tennis universe!), it's all about the journey on how Richard got them to that point. Much has been said already about Will Smith's lead performance, and let's just go ahead and say it: he is fantastic in this role, and his Best Actor Oscar nomination is already assured (with a win quite likely). The rest of the cast is equally great. Check out a pivotal scene between Richard and his wife Brandy (played by Aunjanue Ellis) when Richard has made a pivotal decision without consulting her. Top-notch acting all around. The movie covers events up to 1994 (when Venus was just 15, and Serena just 13). I had forgotten the details of Venus' first tournament as a pro. It gave me the chills as I watched this.<br/><br/>\"King Richard\" was supposed to be released exactly a year ago, but a little thing called COVID-19 had other plans (and almost almost brought the movie theaters industry to its knees). The movie FINALLY premiered in theaters this weekend, while also simultaneously streaming on HBO Max (where I caught it). Despite universal acclaim for both the movie (certified 92% Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and for Will Smith, the film underwhelmed at the box office (just $5 mill, significantly below expectations and projections). It's not hard to see why: this is not an \"action\" movie or a movie about superstars Venus and Serena. It is a nuanced character study of a man with obvious flaws but who also surprises us in other ways. If that sounds like it might be your cup of tea, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in theaters or on HBO Max, or later on other streaming platforms and also on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">The Merriam-Webster dictionary definition of hagiography is \"biography of saints or venerated persons.\" And haven't director Reinaldo Green and star Will Smith done that here with their portrait of Richard Williams, father of the Williams sisters, two of the most famous players in the history of women's tennis? Well maybe not completely but the glass here is certainly a lot more half full than half empty.<br/><br/>In some respects, Zach Baylin's screenplay does a decent enough job pointing out a number of Richard Williams' admirable qualities. First of all there's his courage in the face of adversity-not only having to endure physical assaults by gang members on the rough streets where the family lived in Compton, California, but also the whole history which we learn about, facing off against racists in the deep South while he was growing up (including the Ku Klux Klan).<br/><br/>And another extremely admirable quality was the fact that Richard did not embrace the militant ideology espoused in certain sectors of the African-American community advocating segregation. He was determined to have his daughters participate as equal competitors in a sport usually thought of as the domain of white privilege. Taking his daughters around to introduce them to various high echelon movers and shakers in the tennis community, took a lot of guts.<br/><br/>The portrayal of Richard's treatment of Venus and Serena is a double-edged sword. Again on the admirable side, there's that excellent scene in which he has his daughters watch the Disney movie Cinderella in order to teach them humility. And later he gets a great deal of flack for not allowing Venus to play in the juniors for three years after she racks up a staggering number of victories.<br/><br/>Richard is basically accused of being overprotective by his wife Oracene (Aunjanue Ellis) but his desire to have the daughters lead a \"normal\" life did prevent them from ending up like young tennis star Jennifer Capriati who was arrested while associating with unsavory drug-addicted characters.<br/><br/>But there was another side of the overprotective dad that perhaps was played down in the film-and that is how Richard was a ruthless disciplinarian who subjected his daughters to a constant regimen of unrelenting practice. There is a good scene in the film where the friction over this issue with Oracene reaches its apotheosis-Richard drives away leaving his daughters in a store and expects them to walk back three miles to their home. All because he felt they were bragging about their success on the tennis courts.<br/><br/>Fortunately his wife persuades him to return to the store and pick the girls up. There's another scene in which Child Welfare authorities were called to the home in which an anonymous neighbor accused Richard of child abuse (accusations of forcing the girls to study too hard and practice tennis for too long). While completely exaggerated, there may have been some truth in the neighbors' perception that Richard was \"pushing\" the girls a little too much.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it could be argued (probably by Richard himself) that without having \"pushed\" the girls, they would never have become tennis champions.<br/><br/>What's missing from the portrait here is Richard's unsavory side. A strict disciplinarian, he hardly loses his temper at all. It's a very favorable view of a man whose pushy demeanor (and ego) alienated many. There's also the issue of shady business dealings as well as infidelity., which are referenced but downplayed.<br/><br/>Nothing is mentioned about his first wife and the children he had with her. One of his daughters from the first marriage no longer talks to him accusing Richard of abandoning the first wife and providing no child support for the family.<br/><br/>King Richard proves to be a mixed bag. I learned a good number of things about Richard Williams that appear to be reasonably historically accurate. His obsession with making his daughters into stars (hatched even before they were born) is a complicated issue and one can make several arguments for and against.<br/><br/>But I think there is the issue of celebrity worship in our culture that the film unfortunately promotes. Venus and Serena's exploits are the stuff of legend I suppose in the tennis world. But the way they're treated here (as well as Richard's hand in molding and guiding them), one can say they're being held up as almost God-like figures.<br/><br/>Part of the mythology is to build the Williams up as very humble people guided by a caring, humble father. One can easily see in this \"authorized\" biopic that Richard was by no means the almost saintly figure being pawned off here. And do you really believe Richard's dark side didn't affect his daughters at all? Recall what African-American tennis player Sloane Stephens said about Serena: \" people's perception of her as being so friendly is not reality.\"<br/><br/>It's instructive to realize that athletic success is ephemeral. How many people today recall the names of the tennis stars even as recent as the 70s and the 80s, when the sport of tennis became a worldwide phenomenon? Among many younger people, probably not many.<br/><br/>Will Smith does a good job capturing Richard William's driven spirit and Aunjanue Ellis as Oracene emphatically makes her case as the neglected wife. I also enjoyed the various actors portraying characters involved in the business of tennis-vultures ready to swoop down and reap the benefits of the Williams sisters' newfound success.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">'King Richard' is a funny film for me. I know the real story is nothing like what is portrayed here, but I was able to get enough out of it to really enjoy the movie anyway. I basically had to look at it as a work of fiction. The filmmakers were clearly terrified to show these characters in their true light, even in the smallest of ways, and probably fair enough too. These are some powerful people.<br/><br/>Will Smith is truly excellent in this movie. He is such a pleasure to watch when he's in this kind of form. He never drops a scene and he puts his heart and soul into the film. He has been nominated for Best Actor and while I think Benedict Cumberbatch will give him a run for his money, I think he will likely take it home.<br/><br/>Aunjanue Ellis has also been nominated in a Supporting Role. She has a lot less to do and isn't anywhere near as memorable or impressive unfortunately. I know the movie is called 'King Richard' and that was who they were choosing to focus on, however I was surprised how little they gave her character to do.<br/><br/>I really like the story structure of the film. It flowed very well and never really stalls at any point. I did think that the tennis match they were building up to at the end didn't feel anywhere near important enough to end the movie on. They made it out to be this big deal, but it just never really felt like that. The tennis scenes in the movie were very well done though it has to be said. They did a great job of making them look professional.<br/><br/>I liked this movie. I found it an inspirational tale. I like the concept of people working and giving everything they have to a dream with no promise of a good final result. I do think they left a lot of drama out and made sure everyone came out looking aces, but c'est la vie. It is what it is. 9/10.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Since having found the 1974 \"Curry Western\" Dacoit film Khhotte Sikkay to be pretty enjoyable,I became very intrigued,when I read a good amount of praise on the IMDb's Indian movie board about a recently realised movie which took a look at one of India's most successful athlete's:Paan Singh Tomar,who later became one of India's most infamous Dacoit's.<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>1980:<br/><br/>Getting information from his informants which could lead to him getting the biggest story of the year, a newspaper reporter rushes to get a relative of his, (who is also taking care of his young niece) to come along with him to the very outskirts in the city,in the hope of finding one of India's most famous Dacoit's:Paan Singh Tomar.<br/><br/>Arriving to the location,the reporter is met by a group of men who claim to be members of Tomar's gang.Due to the group being unsure about how genuine he is,they decide to keep the niece and uncle as a \"safe guarantee\",and tell the reporter that he is the only one who they will allow to meet Tomar.Taking him to their hideaway based at a run down building,the reporter finally gets his chance to come face to face with Paan Singh Tomar.<br/><br/>Tomar shows a strong dislike for the reporter,due to him deciding to get straight to the point and making his first question be :\"How did you become a Dacoit?\"<br/><br/>Fearing that he is about to lose the scoop of the year,the reporter does a hasty back track,and instead decides to make his first question: \"When did you pick up a gun for the first time?\".<br/><br/>Feeling that the report may actually be here for more than just a \"cheap thrill\",Tomar begins to tell him,how he went from being a 7 time Steeplechase champion surrounded by people whose tradition he deeply respected,to finding himself chewed up and spat out into a world filled with betrayers of any tradition,which lead to him deciding that the only one who could do the right thing and show that corruption did not decay everything around people:was himself.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>For the handful of cars and motorbikes that appear in the film,director Tigmanshu Dhulia shows them right at the very edge of the frame,to give a strong feeling that they are about to drive off to a completely different era miles away from the movie.Despite the very best attempts from my DVD players to stop me from seeing this film, (the first player jammed at the half way point,and ended up constantly bringing up the sign \"No DVD in player\",whilst my spare DVD player would only play the film in black and white!) they were thankfully unable to stop Dhulia's tremendous directing from shining.<br/><br/>With Dhulia choosing specific moments in Tomar's athletic career and Dacoit period to use a slow-mo effect to show Paan gaining the respect of his peers in the athletic ranks,to slowing down the moments when fatal shots are fired during a number of terrific,tense gun battles, (with a stand out one being a shoot out that Dhulia beautifully sets in the middle of a river) to show that the applause Tomar use to hear during his moments of glory,have now been replaced with the sound of people taking their final breath.<br/><br/>Looking at the fantastic screenplay of the film, (which IMDb has weirdly not credited) Writers Dhulia and Sanjay Chauhan brilliantly take the traditional Wild West \"baddie\" role,and spin it into a new exciting direction.Using Paan Singh Tomar's (played by a great.focused Irrfan Khan) athletics training as a place filled with \"old guard\" traditional soldiers and police officers,who teach Tomar skills about concentrating and being determined,which would also be given to any lonely gunslinger,who finds themselves to be the only brave enough person to protect a town from being taken over.<br/><br/>Getting away from the athletics,Dhulia and Chauhan use Tomar's family farmland being taken over by a ruthless gang,as the moment for when Tomar calls for the cavalry to arrive and save the day.Sadly for Tomar, Dhulia and Chauhan expertly show that the era when \"the cavalry\" and other figures who are meant to stand up and protect the \"common man's\" town from being over run with outlaws,and to also wear a badge of authority (such as a sheriffs badge) with honour,instead of seeing it as just a cheap piece of silver.<br/><br/>Getting Tomar to see all of the corruptions and tragedy's happening around,the writers slowly show Tomar relies that he is the last person left,who strongly keeps to the tradition of knowing what good and evil is,which leads to him having to make an unimaginable decision of leaving \"the cavalry\" and everything he has valued for his whole life,to become the thing that he has hated most,in the hope of having the chance to do the right thing.</div>\n",

Talented Filmmaker Tigmanshu Dhulia makes a biopic, that turns out to be a dazzling experience! Its a Well-Made Film in all respects.<br/><br/>'Paan Singh Tomar' works because the journey of the late Athlete/Dacoit keeps you engrossed &amp; captivated. Here's a biopic, that mixes reality with entertainment. Though a heavy subject, 'Paan Singh Tomar' offers humor, action &amp; most of all, a strong moral! Tigmanshu Dhulia &amp; Sanjay Chauhan's Screenplay mixes reality &amp; entertainment, most efficiently. Tigmanshu Dhulia's Direction is flawless. Cinematography &amp; Editing, are excellent.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Irrfan shines as 'Paan Singh Tomar'. The versatile actor proves his mettle once again by delivering a performance, that deserves a National-Award. Without a doubt, this is his finest performance to date. Mahi Gill plays her part well. Vipin Sharma, Rajendra Gupta, Imran Hasnee, Nawazuddin Siddiqui &amp; Zakir Hussain are decent. Brijendra Kala is astonishing in a brief, yet important role.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'Paan Singh Tomar' is A Big Winner! Strongly Recommended!</div>\n",

      "The acting in this film is the shinning point. Especially the main actor Irfaan khan made a great impression on my mind by his excellent acting skill. Irfaan excellently potrayed the emotion of a \"runner\" who is suffering from pain, frustration and exhaustion, but he is not giving up. The rest is the portrayal of a man who has never had it easy in his life but nonetheless keeps his heart. The screenplay is brilliant. Being a biopic of an army guy/athlete who turned into a dacoit won't b a happy/fun movie. It's a very sad movie. But Irfann did manage to evoke some light moments by his sheer one liners n acting. Imagine an athlete who's very good in running has to run away from police. The direction was good n the cinematography was good capturing the harsh, dry, rural difficult terrain.</div>\n",

It narrates the story about an Indian athlete who turns into a dacoit and the film is brilliantly handled. The film slowly and steadily seeps you into the world of the athlete. The film starts brilliantly and slowly and gradually shows us how the athlete turns into a dacoit. The scenes of the army are well handled, there are some funny moments and some tense ones but the intense portions are more towards the second half when Irrfan becomes a dacoit and till the end the film keeps you involved. There are several brilliant scenes like the relationship between Rajendra Gupta and Irrfan Khan, Irrfan-Mahi Gill, The icecream scene, the climax The film does tend to get predictable but that is forgiven<br/><br/>Direction by Tigmanshu Dhulia is fab Music is limited<br/><br/>Irrfan Khan lives the role, he gets into the character so perfectly that it is unimaginable to see anyone in that role Mahi Gill is decent, Rajendra Gupta is excellent, Brijendra Kala is superb, Vipin Sharma is excellent, Imran Hasnee is good Nawazuddin Siddiqui in a short role does a superb job Jehangir Khan is superb</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Beginning with a confession, I really felt both proud as well as ashamed after watching this honest well crafted film revealing the bitter truth of our Indian Social System through its powerful narrative.<br/><br/>PROUD, because the film perfectly proves to be a true example of CINEMA made in the right manner for the overall benefit of the society. CINEMA, as per my understanding is a powerful medium of expression which basically needs to serve two main purposes. It has to entertain as well as enlighten its viewers about the various important issues prevailing in the system which need to be addressed urgently. <br/><br/>To be precise, how many of us ever knew about this character called PAAN SINGH TOMAR who actually existed in our society a few decades ago? We all love Cricket so much, remembering all its record makers and breakers on our tips. But how many of us ever knew about this seven-time NATIONAL CHAMPION in steeplechase (obstacle) race, a born athlete who later had to pick up arms and became a hard-core WANTED rebel (not Dacoit) of Beeharh? The film enlightens us all about Paan Singh's sad life-story and thus fulfills its duty of being a \"True Cinematic Effort\" made by Tigmanshu, Irfan and the team. <br/><br/>It also made me remember another proud product of our Indian Film Industry, BANDIT QUEEN directed by Shekhar Kapoor in 1994, which is till date considered to be a major benchmark in the history of Film-making in India. Interestingly, (as reported) director Tigmashu Dhulia worked with Shekhar in this project only in his early days.<br/><br/>Before moving on to the acidic part of this write-up, I would like to say that as a movie, it's a gripping experience which works majorly in its first half with a pinch of comic moments too, added brilliantly in its screenplay. The second half expectedly talks about the transformation part which can also be considered as just another 'Vengeance Saga' by many critiques. Well supported by a spectacular cinematography, sharp editing and an award winning performance by Irfan Khan, it's a worth watching gem striking a difficult balance between the life of a sportsman and a rebel. Though as I felt, the background score could have been better but still it serves the purpose well while watching the film. But here instead of giving you a review, I would like to mention a few dialogues of the film, which should be enough to prove the precious value of this rare gem coming out of Bollywood after a long time.<br/><br/>As the film starts off, Paan Singh informs his officer saying, \"Hamaar Mama Beeharh Ke Baaghi Thhey, Dacait Nahin",
      "..Aur Bahut Izzat Thi Unki Purey Ziley Mein!\"<br/><br/>On being addressed as a Daku by the reporter in his interview, Paan Singh comes forward and says, \"'Beeharh Mein Baaghi Hotey Hain",
      "..Dacait Milte Hain Parliament Mein'.<br/><br/>In the last meeting (after becoming a rebel) with his supportive Military Officer, the Officer leaves Paan Singh saying, \"Ab Main Tumse Kabhi Nahin Milunga Aur Yeh Hamari Aakhri Mulaqaat Hogi\"",
      "",
      "..but to this Paan Singh replies, \"Par Khabrein Milti Rahengi!\"<br/><br/>And lastly, on hearing the radio, broadcasting the news of Paan Singh Tomar's search by the Police all over, he laughs in anger and says, \"Jab Desh Ke Liye Bhaaga, Tab Kisi Ne Nahin Poocha",
      "",
      "",
      ", Ab Beeharh Mein Bhaag Rahey Hain To Saaley Sab Naam Jap Rahey Hain!\"<br/><br/>So, if the above few dialogues cannot convince you to watch PAAN SINGH TOMAR as soon as possible then I seriously don't know what else can.<br/><br/>Now coming to the harsh part of this write-up, I felt ashamed after watching this flick due to more than one reason related to both Bollywood as well as the political social system we are living in.<br/><br/>Taking up Bollywood first, it was really a shame that this well-made film was lying in cans, waiting to get released for more than one year for some undisclosed reasons. The word CINEMA is complete only if we keep on making films on diversified subjects related with its various genres. Otherwise it will be just like eating the same dish in dinner every day leading to boredom. So if films like PAAN SINGH TOMAR will continue finding difficulties in getting released then Who will like to make them in the near future?<br/><br/>The next was the bigger shock which came in the end when they showed a whole list of names on the black screen, who were NATIONAL Champions in OLYMPICS and other games but had died eventually either due to lack of medical treatment or being penniless. Reading the list scrolling on the screen I asked to myself, <br/><br/>\"Are these talented people, the NATIONAL TREASURES of the country only till the day they can perform on the field?<br/><br/>Don't they remain the same NATIONAL TREASURES once they get retired? <br/><br/>And Isn't this a NATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY of the Nation's Government to take care of all these gifted personalities after their retirement, till their last breath and give them a honorable farewell in the end?\".<br/><br/>The same principle applies to every art form including the Film Industry, where we have recently seen veterans like A. K. Hangal in a sorry state asking for monetary help on the national news channels. <br/><br/>So this is not a review of the film PAAN SINGH TOMAR but a humble tribute from my side along with Tigmanshu and Irfan Khan, for such blessed souls who were sadly not treated well by our own society. Paan Singh may have opted for a wrong or debatable path in order to fight for this own rights. But had the Government been there to take care of him in those difficult days, considering him as A NATIONAL TREASURE, we could have got a great COACH instead of a REBEL running in the Beeharh.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Paan Singh Tomar, based on a true story of an athlete-turned-rebel , was an encouraging , sit-up and make-you-think movie which ends on a sad note. An athlete(Irrfan Khan) joins the army to serve for the country but is encouraged to participate in distance running in international competition because of his great stamina, high energy and good running speed. Soon he brings laurels for his country after winning several gold medals and appreciation. But his success is short lived when he enters into fight with his relatives in his village over a land feud. Though , he wins the fight in village panchayat , he and his family are threatened for life. He goes back to army and even approaches police for help but his efforts goes in vain. Unfortunately , he had no options but to pick guns to protect his family which turns him into a dreaded dacoit. Paan Singh Tomar is directed by Tigmanshu Dhulia (Haasil , Sahib Bibi and Gangster). It takes a great effort to make a film of this stature. The director has not only handled the hard-hitting true story of a rebel but he has also portrayed the forgotten sportsman in an outstanding way. The screenplay is executed superbly along with some fantastic dialogues. Cinematography was eye-catching which captured the rough terrain of Chambal valley. There were couple of scenes which stands out particularly the sequence at the police station where Irrfan blast the cop for not following his duty diligently. On the flip side , I thought the race sequence could have been made more thrilling. But the brilliant performance by supremely talented actor compensates for it. Irrfan Khan plays the role of Paan Singh Tomar to T. He is just perfect fit for this role where he had to emotes the character of a sportsman and brilliantly turning into a rebel. He has done it all. Vipin Sharma was effective , Mahie Gill was good. So ,overall , a brilliant movie in all aspects. Watch out for the superlative performance of Irrfan Khan and splendid direction. But most importantly , the movie gives out a message to us – Have the government done justice to the Indian Sportsmen who have brought laurels and medals for our country ? Watch this flick ",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Paan Singh Tomar is a movie about poor man from a remote village of India. He achieves the honor of breaking various records in racing. After getting retired, there is a dispute that sets against his family. Even a national asset is not supported by officials, this in turn makes him a dacoit. The story goes further, he and his associates kill several people for wealth, helping poor. Gradually he dies at the hands of police and story ends.<br/><br/>A movie is now made for suffering national assets, an extra mark for that. Even the Olympic champions sometimes do not gain the deserving respect from officials (in the form of making a living at ease). Government must arrange for certain ways that this doesn't happen at least to people who are nation's pride. I personally did not like Irrfan's acting, a negative mark for that. Somebody who's more flexible physically, would have been well suited for the role. A movie worth a watch, because of the message it sends.<br/><br/>Rating: 8.0/10</div>\n",

It is worth a watch just for Irfan Khan.<br/><br/>I have not heard of this man, till I knew of this movie, its good to know of such sportsman and sad to know the tragedy. The fate of the country is such that a national champion is forgotten but a dacoit is made news easily. This is an ironic story and is told really very well. Dialogues are written extremely well. The dialect is just great, It brings out rawness to character and a flavor of its own to the whole script. <br/><br/>The cinematography is done well, and the director sure has an eye for detail the way he has shown a few things, like a steeplechase race, dacoit's backdrop and the feuds in villages. Mind you this is a biopic and has to be handled in way to tell a real life character, there is no much added drama, at few places, it might have fallen bland too of course life is not so very interesting all times either. But all are pu together effectively to bring out a story that has a heart. We may not be in favor of Paan Singh by the end for what he has done, but fir sure he shall live on in the minds long after the movie is over.<br/><br/>Watch it for Dialect/Dialogues and yes for Irfan Khan who may be sweeping many best actor awards for reprising this role and living it in a way thats so tough to do in terms of controlling emotions and thus exhibiting them at rare times.<br/><br/>Liked it and I recommend such biopics be watched to know India and its diversity in a better way too. My rating is 4/5 for a movie that has been dared to be made and executed really well.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">A rural setting, horses, dacoits and guns or so was the popular Bollywood theme during the 70's and the 80's. With the typical good guys vs. bad theme, 'Sholay' ranks highest on recall. But, Tigmanshu Dhulia's 'Paan Singh Tomar' differs from the rest. It presents the other side of the story, a disturbing tale of a disciplined soldier and a national athlete who is dumped by the system and forced into a path of violence. <br/><br/>While the makers don't call it an exact biopic, the film is reportedly based on the true story of the soldier turned rebel and that Dhulia heard about that story while working as a casting director on the sets of 'Bandit Queen' in Chambal. What follows is intense research, including interviews with Paan Singh's surviving family members.<br/><br/>The tale begins with a journalist (Brijendra Kala) interviewing the Chambal valley's much feared 'baaghi' Paan Singh (Irrfan Khan) who reminisces his life. <br/><br/>Cut to early post-independence era, Paan Singh is a young army recruit with a gluttonous appetite. Although disinterested in sports, he joins the sports division, the clincher being that there would be no restriction on food there. <br/><br/>Soon, Paan Singh's talent as a runner is discovered by his coach who trains him for the 3000m steeplechase culminating in the protagonist becoming the national champion and record holder who represents India in the 1958 Asian Games and gold at the International defense athletics. Over time, he grows in rank and becomes a 'subedar'. <br/><br/>Success apart, personal commitments lead him to early retirement and he also denies a coaching job for the services athletics team. But, fate has different plans for him as a family feud leads him to take up arms and turn into a rebel who operated near the borders of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan during 1979-81. <br/><br/>Since the story traverses through decades, from early post-independence days to early eighties, recreating the setting is a production nightmare. The director responds to it by restricting all scenes to village lanes, athletic stadiums and the rugged terrain of Chambal. The focus, nevertheless, remains on the lead character and never does the film lose itself in sub-plots or item songs, which is otherwise typical to this genre. <br/><br/>Script and direction apart, what keeps the movie together are the gripping performances by the lead actors. Irrfan Khan is said to have trained with athletes and even nursed a sports injury, the results are visible on the screen as he looks the part. He is ably supported by Mahie Gill who plays his wife and Vipin Joshi, better known for playing the demanding dad in 'Taare Zameen Par' plays Major Masand.<br/><br/>Befittingly, the film ends with a tribute to India's unsung athletic heroes who died penniless including one who sold his gold medal. Indirectly, the film critiques our country's poor sports administration and takes a massive dig at the lacunae in law enforcement which could turn a sportsman/ soldier into a criminal. <br/><br/>It goes without saying that in our country, we hardly know any sport outside Cricket. I'm sure that before this movie released, most of us never cared to know what 'steeplechase' was. As an aftereffect of this movie, hope somebody wakes up and chooses to train talented sportsmen from interior parts of the country! <br/><br/>As of now, the film is already successful. If you haven't seen it yet, make sure you watch it before it exits the big screen. Irrfan Khan makes it totally worthwhile!</div>\n",

Other than that the story is also worth watching once. What I felt in the starting was that the events were rushed. For around half an hour in the starting it seemed as if I was watching things with the feel of a documentary. However the film picked up pace and was on right track after the half time. Rarely are films made on subjects like these in India. The acting by the supporting cast was unimpressive. However Irrfan can steal any show. The regional language used in the film all the time makes the film much more compelling. Many a times I suffered with the syndrome of – \"It should have been this way.\" But overall the film is a must watch for Indian audience.<br/><br/>\"A definite one time watch for everyone.\"</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">A Biopic is not the most interesting genre of film. However, Bollywood has made two memorable biopics in the past few years. Paan Singh Tomar is based on the life of a national steeplechase champion who did not get the recognition that he deserved and eventually became a dacoit in order to have his name printed in newspapers.<br/><br/>Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, which was based on the life of Milkha Singh, has borrowed some elements from this magnificent movie which has managed to restore my faith in this genre. <br/><br/>Paan Singh Tomar is played by Irrfan Khan who gives a career-best performance which is quite impressive considering the number of notable movies he has made. He plays the character in a nuanced manner that incorporates the unique dialect from his native place in Madhya Pradesh. The dedication to his role is palpable as he transforms himself, both physically and mentally, to play someone who has a lot of anger inside him due to the apathy of the Army and the Indian Media for not giving him his due recognition.<br/><br/>Paan Singh Tomar epitomizes the struggle of athletes in India to gain recognition despite endless hard work and complete apathy from the government. There are a lot of changes that must be implemented to ensure that these athletes get proper training and diet to give their best performance.<br/><br/>This movie is one of the finest to have come out from Bollywood. The producers must be given credit to back such a film in which the protagonist was largely unknown to the masses. The film accurately depicts the lifestyle in villages and the authenticity is further escalated by the unique dialect that all the characters use. Watch Irrfan Khan give one of the most memorable performance by an Indian actor.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">A stunner.. An Indian Rambo, far far away from the horse-borne dacoits and cheesy dialogs of similar films. Reportedly based on the life and times of an Indian army subedar, the film is a piece of history. That an army man finds civilian life difficult is well known. But this man took up arms because of the failure of the civilian administration to address his problems, as well as the army's failure to intervene, or at least coordinate with the administration, so that an illustrious ex-army man like Paan Singh had to undergo the travails that he did.<br/><br/>This film is a lesson on how to make films, which are entertaining, and not over-the-top. It is also a history lesson, for those in power, who see this sort of tragedy occurring in the lives of common people, but do nothing, till trouble comes knocking at their own doors.<br/><br/>Hats off to the team of PAAN SINGH TOMAR - the film. May their tribe increase.</div>\n",

That that never could have been is grub for challenges forsaken in the interest of undoing undone to keep challenges alive in their wake. While the story of a famed athlete finding his calling in black might seem exotic thematization of a non-prevalent zeitgeist, its tenability as fallout of subjectivity in a License Raj is contemporizing licenses as licenses engendered in licenses whether you like it, or not!</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">India is probably one of the few countries in the world with various distinct cultures and their own history. In such a nation there were (and are) innumerous people whose life contains all ingredients for a nail-biting tales but sadly biopics are hardly explored in the country. Tigmanshu Dhulia showed guts to pen a script on one of unsung heroes of Indian sports Paan Singh Tomar and end result is a captivating cinema that explores many facets of our system. Paan Singh Tomar is an interesting journey of a loyal soldier and a brilliant athlete (infact a national pride) who transforms into a notorious \"dacoit\" thanks to the 'system\". In a flashback mode the movie deals on the drastic transformation of this loyal army-man into a notorious dacoit (Baaghi as referred by Paan Singh himself). In a linear and simple story PST tells about the plight of an athlete who had brought honours for his own country. Negligence of system is highlighted through his sad tale and the story revolves on framework after independence when seeds of corruption &amp; anti establishment were germinating in full swing. In one sequence Paan Singh tells a journalist that how he was ignored by media when he won medal in steeple chase race in an international army sports meet but now when he was in the other side of the law playing hide-and-seek with the police the journalists are pouring down to get interviews. Another pain stacking sequence shows Paan Singh going to local police to lodge a complaint but he was humiliated by the inspector and even insulted the gold medal which he won for his own country. Tigmanshu dhulia' eye for detailing needs to be acknowledged. While writing the script Dhulia ensured that the audiences identify with the character and gets involved with the proceedings. The crowds were cheering in the initial reels when Paan Singh's potential as an athlete was displayed following which his cry for justice which was put down by the corrupt system. As the film reaches the climax the neglected scenario of athletes indeed touches the emotional chords of the audience. Dhulia's execution makes you think as you leave the theatre. In terms of technicalities Editing and Art department deserves mention. Dhulia's direction is complimented by Irfan Khan who played the role of Paan Singh Tomar with perfection. His nuances, dialogs, expression, body language speaks about a perfect army men. Brownie points should be given to him for his efforts to shape his body at this age and mould himself as the young energetic athlete. His dialogue delivery in the later reels reflected the strive within as he becomes a rebel with a cause. \"Bihad mein baghi hote hai, dacoit toh parliament mein bante hai\" – this dialogue will be remembered in from now on. A performance that deserves full marks and demands awards, this one is easily one of Irfan's career best performances. The supporting casts were appropriate in their roles. Mahie Gill as Tomar's wife gave a good performance again. Vipin Sharma was a treat to watch in role of Major Masand, a senior to Tomar and one who believed in his potential. Brijendra Kala is as usual dependable and brought a comic flavour as a journalist. With the current scenario of the nation movies like Paan Singh Tomar needs to be made and promoted which injects \"thoughts\" inside audience in an entertaining way. It's when the movie ends, and the names of four Indian national champions who died penniless are shown, \"Paan Singh Tomar\" hits the most. Indeed a fitting tribute to unsung heroes of Indian sports. This movie needs to be watched and pondered upon. Tigmanshu Dhulia : Take a bow.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Boosted By An Excellent Performance by Irfan Khan and the rest of the cast, and a meaningful and good story, Pan Singh Tomar is one of the better bollywood movies which has great performances from the cast, a great story which is worth telling, and Irfan Khan just makes it better with his excellent portrayel of his character.<br/><br/>The Story is about a Daku(Dacoit)(Irfan) who was actually a soldier who fought for his country and could give it all for his country who then became a runner and wins gold medal at the Indian national games, but is forced to become a Dacoit after being neglected and insulted by the Police,and his mission is to rebel and defy the police department.<br/><br/>Irfan Khan is one of the few Hollywood worthy actors in bollywood, and probably the best at what he does, he yet again shows his excellent acting qualities in this movie by giving an excellent performance as Paan Singh Tomar, and he has shown the change of his character from a strict soldier to a notorious dacoit with utmost skill. The Rest of the cast also does a very good job in making this into a very well acted movie.<br/><br/>The Director does a decent job in making this film into one of the sensible movies made in bollywood, and good job from him for giving Irfan a perfect role in the movie. The Story which is based on a true story about the same man, is great and shows how many extremely talented athletes in India are neglected by the government and how they can become notorious at times. <br/><br/>Overall this movie is great due to mainly an excellent performance by Irfan Khan and a great story, to make this into one of the better movies of 2012 till now.<br/><br/>My Rating: 7.8/10</div>\n",

Though that might be a exaggeration given the small body of work he has done, but films like Namesake, and Paan Singh Tomar puts him in the list of such elites. He gets into the role. He looks the character he is performing. One hell of a power-packed performance by Irrfan. He carries the entire film on his shoulder. The direction, the characters and characterization, background music, almost everything in this movie is top-notch. To make it even classier, I thought the camera work could have even been classier. Regardless, its a must watch movie for any serious movie lover.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Always Promising Tigmanshu Dhulia has finally delivered its master piece in form of a biopic Paan singh Tomar. The well done research and time proved the right ingredient for the cult classic. India has one good movie which deals with sports (exception of Chak De! India), which is highly unlikely in bollywood portrayals. <br/><br/>The steeplechase race was another unlikely sport, but on silver screen the first half was marvelous. Dhulia and Irrfan right from Haasil was a good Jodi altogether. They both had their due finally. Right from being the assistant Director from Bandit Queen and the association with Shekar Kapur proved this movie worth of its salt. A word of mouth story melting with the glitterati of glamor world was significantly fantastic. Irrfan delivered its another best, totally involving in the character. The races and practice never looked superficial and had content till the depth. While irrfan transition from an Athlete to that of a dacoit in the middle ages man was brilliant. All credit goes to the actor himself. He is such a silk, crease-less.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Dhulia was another remarkable feat reached to the zenith. The movie had its touch of emotions raking the nervous right till the end of credit roll. It will keep you glued to the fact of unjust poverty our athletes face. The raw and bitter facts were introduced and a subtle take on today's IPL and Cricket frenzy nation was very obvious. Did anyone know of Paan singh or the Steeplechase race sport ever? I bet !!<br/><br/>The rustic approach as always of central and eastern India could not be better than this. The chambal valley was shown with villages had a sense of accomplishment. While the army barracks and story was very close to the real story. The steeplechase running sequence with a flashing editing was a stealer. You can notice the hand swirl before every jump. The expression and deep eyes of Paan singh was the keystroke of Irrfan captured very well. The story of dacoit and its ply was smooth and explained the unjust system of Indian politico. Even the caste system deeply rooted and supported by police and politics was well directed. Dhulia was excellent in portraying the small details of a subedaar's personal life and his love towards his lady. There was humor in all the movie. The end could have been no better. The chambal became steeple- chased for Paan Singh Tomar. Making the story out of interviewing Tomar's surviving family members and visiting his native village, Dhulia was really Intrigued about Tomar's largely forgotten several records is an achievement in itself. India and its apathy towards the Olympians are a food for thought. A powerful film made into a cult.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">First of all, no beating about the bush, Irrfan Khan is the best actor in the country. Aye, I mean better than great talents like Nawazuddin, Aamir and Ajay Devgan. This man seems to hit it out of the park again and again, consistently blowing the expectations of Indian Audiences to smithereens. This movie is carried on the broad shoulders of Irrfan, who like Ken Watanabe has become face of his country in Hollywood -- and very deserving. <br/><br/>This movie is made as well as it could have been made. It deserved to go to the Oscars, but the naive Indian Film authority has chosen a far inferior film called Barfi to represent India at Oscars. It is my Opinion that Indian films can never grow if every year only a big star is given Best Actor Award. If you are a big star, and you had a moderately good performance, then boom, you win the best actor for the year. I hated how Ranbir Kapoor chosen as best actor over Irrfan Khan....In Bollywood,stardom and parental influence reigns.<br/><br/>The movie is about an athlete, who represents India at National and International levels and win many medals and honors for the country. This disinterested sportsman slowly unravels in him a streak of immeasurable success consistently over the period of 15 years. When he retires, he falls into the dark world of Indian corruption and police, when his relative grabs his piece of land and police just wouldn't help him. In times of desperateness, Paan Singh Tomar takes up a gun to fight for his own. And the rest of the story is about what steps he takes to win over his land and take over those who oppose him. It might seem like Art Film, but believe me, this Film is TOTAL FUN. Never a dull moment, never a clichéd scene, and not one useless dialogue. This film is a triumph.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">When you have a powerful script at hand, you do not need a 'SRK/SALMAN' to sell it ....Bollywood is back with one such script.<br/><br/>The story is about Paan Singh Tomar. A national record breaking sprinter who became a rebel. He started his career in the military, was one of the best that there was. One fine day, he delivers an ice cream to a general in 4 minutes and we have an athlete in the making. He does a fine job at National level of sports. When he returns to his village, he tries to battle with the police to get his fields back from one of the villagers and all his attempts to do things the right way fail miserably. When one of his very own is hurt, he cannot control it any longer and decides to take the law in his hand. This marks the birth of a goon and we all know how their life ends.The dialog even in the dialect: \"When I ran for my country, hardly anyone knew me,but now that I am goon, I have become the talk of the town\" creates stirs throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Mahie Gill hardly gets to act, but is OK in her parts. However the movie solely belongs to Irrfan Khan; from a soldier to an athlete and from a national champion to a goon, he is top notch. This actor deserves a standing ovation for this role. Tigamanshu Dhulia (after Saheb, Biwi aur Gangster) is emerging as one of the few under-rated and fine directors that Bollywood has (Vishal Bharadwaj, Anurag Kashyap).<br/><br/>The movie does get a bit dull in parts and hence would not tag this as a 'masterpeice' but Tigmanshu surely leaves his mark with the film depicting the unsung heroes of Indian sports.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">One of the best sports biopic ever made in Bollywood and what a stellar performance by Irrfan ( Award Winning Performance)...For me everything worked in this one and the proper research was done about the athlete making it descriptive as well as entertaining alongside...A year after Bhaag Milkha Bhaag released and must say enjoyed that as well though I cried a lot in the latter but what matters to me is an urge to watch again when on TV which is the case with former, ie, Paan Singh Tomar is a much better movie...Farhan Akhtar was no where an inch closer to what Irrfan was...Now let's talk about the main aspects in the movie, ie, dialogues, direction and screenplay...All these things are incredible but the screenplay falls a bit in the second half but it picks up afterwards of Paan Singh Tomar whereas Bhaag Milkha Bhaag was a bit overdramatised which was a plus point for the foremost...Lastly, would say that after watching Paan Singh, everybody will come to know what they were about to miss, if not seen they would regret and Bhaag Milkhas cons...A must visit!!</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Paan Singh Tomar is a feather in the cap for critically acclaimed director and writer Tigmanshu Dhulia. It is one of the best biopics i have ever seen and the character of Paan Singh has been made immortal by the superb performance from Irrfan Khan. The entire script, screenplay is good, while dialogues are made awesome by the superb delivery from all the actors. For the uninitiated: the movie's dialogues are not in Hindi but in a very rustic UP language, which is the true USP of this masterpiece.<br/><br/>Irrfan Khan has risen as an actor and how! I first saw him in Dhulia's debut - Haasil in 2003 and since then Irrfan has only bettered himself with each of his roles. Obviously some credit needs to go to Dhulia for extracting the best from him. Irrfan really gets into this character of Paan Singh and delivers stupendously. Some sequences are an absolute delight to watch, like when the reporter meets Paan Singh for the first time, and almost all the scenes between Paan Singh and his wife. Mahie Gill also delivers beautifully as the shy village girl.<br/><br/>Not much has been written about Paan Singh and what he did for the country. The movie is an eye opener of some sort about unsung heroes of Indian sports. The disappointing part is, such heroes come to light through cinema only when they die or are converted to goons like in the case of Paan Singh Tomar! Nonetheless, an excellent piece of cinema. We want more such movies.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">This is an extremely sentimental and worthwhile film that fans of Hollywood's Golden Age should see at least once. While I don't think it's director John Ford's best film (I preferred HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY, THE QUIET MAN and FORT APACHE), it is superb and well-crafted. Some of the acting (in particular Jane Darwell as \"Ma\") was terrific and very realistic, while occasionally it was a bit over the top (John Carradine as \"the Preacher\"). And the story itself was excellent and well-constructed--making an emotional and heart-felt appeal for justice and a more Socialist nation in response to the poverty of the Great Depression. You can't help but be sucked into the pitiful yet somehow hopeful lives of the Joad family. While some of the facts were definitely exaggerated in order to make this point (making it a one-dimensional fight between good and evil), the overall message of upheaval and loss was important and potent.<br/><br/>I am a history teacher and so naturally I gravitate to films like THE GRAPES OF WRATH. It is an amazingly powerful film that is extremely touching and lovingly made--though historically, some of the film is pretty much fiction. While most web sites I checked praised the book, one presents a thoughtful and documented analysis of the actual Okie experience and compares it to the book and movie--coming up with many ways in which THE GRAPES OF WRATH isn't a totally accurate portrait of the times. Some examples cited were the general success the \"Okies\" had when they arrived in California, that the exodus to California from most of America PRE-DATED the Dust Bowl years and the Dust Bowl itself had very little actual impact on Oklahoma (though it DID affect Kansas and some other states considerably). This isn't to say that the film is completely fiction or it was a bad book or that Steinbeck was a Communist, but that Steinbeck wasn't always careful in his research and seemed to stretch facts to make his social and political statement. See for yourself--it makes interesting reading at: http://www.newcriterion.com/archive/20/jun02/steinbeck.htm</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">John Ford's film of John Steinbeck's novel has deservedly a classic film mirroring the views of both men and the times the book was written and filmed. Ford won his second Oscar for Best Director and Jane Darwell was the Best Supporting Actress of 1940.<br/><br/>For most of America the Depression started with the stock market crash of 1929. But for the farmers it really began at the end of World War I. Those were good years for agriculture, the war in Europe was a boom for agriculture. But when farm prices dropped after the Armistice, a whole lot of family farms went belly up. Lots of people left the farms for the big city and industry jobs. The Depression years unhappily coincided with some of the worst drought ever seen in America.<br/><br/>This is what many families like the Joads were facing in 1939 when the book was written. The banks had foreclosed on land that had withered to dust in any event. Folks like the Joads picked up and moved elsewhere, like California on a rumor of prosperity and jobs. <br/><br/>America was still changing from an agricultural to an industrial society back then. That causes a lot of trouble for people unskilled in any industrial job training. As a country we're going through something similar today in many areas. We're moving from an industrial to an information based economy. Industry jobs are being lost to other nations and older and poorer workers are suffering for it. It's progress I guess, but it takes its toll.<br/><br/>Some factory worker who has lost his job for any number of reasons can identify to some degree with the Joads, especially if they've lost a home they owned. For the Joads it was worse because they made their living off the land for many generations, identifying with it in a way that industrial workers could not.<br/><br/>Henry Fonda got his first Oscar nomination for Tom Joad. To get the part which he knew he was so right for, he signed a studio contract with 20th Century Fox. That caused him many problems later on, but those are stories for another film review. <br/><br/>Tom Joad is a midwest country kid, a whole lot like Fonda himself. Part of the story of The Grapes of Wrath is Tom himself trying to figure out why these economic forces are crushing him and his family and the way of life he's known. In the end when he leaves the Joad family and hits the open road, he's not got all the answers, but he's asking the questions. Tom hasn't figured it out, but a lot of people with many letters after their names haven't either. He only knows that he's got to get in the fight for economic justice.<br/><br/>Jane Darwell was in films from the earliest silent films to Mary Poppins in 1965. This became her career part and the mother role of all time. She's what holds the Joad family together in good times and bad. That's what moms do and get little recognition for it. Except in this case by the Motion Picture Academy.<br/><br/>John Carradine has his career part in this also. Another John Ford favorite, Carradine plays Casy the defrocked preacher who as he tells it disgraced himself with a female parishioner. After that preaching the gospel didn't seem quite right. When Fonda meets Carradine after Fonda's been released from prison, Carradine is asking a lot of questions about what is man's place in the metaphysical scheme of things. He's developing what we would now call situational ethics. Carradine's questions are on a higher plane, but he certainly inspires Fonda to ask for some answers himself.<br/><br/>The Grapes of Wrath illustrates that at least government can give first aid in a crisis. After being in privately run agricultural camps where they're treated like less than dirt, the Joads happen upon a camp run by the Department of Agriculture where at least they're treated like humans. As it turns out, the Secretary of Agriculture was one Henry A. Wallace who was running for Vice President that year with Franklin D. Roosevelt. I'll bet any number of people saw The Grapes of Wrath and saw a message of support for FDR and the New Deal.<br/><br/>Given some of the problems of the American economy today, The Grapes of Wrath though it appears dated isn't really all that much a relic of our past. It's both a timeless book and a timeless classic film.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Grapes of Wrath, The (1940) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>I'm sure many could take a political angle when discussing John Steinbeck's novel, which was the bases for this film, which today is considered one of the greatest pictures ever made but I think trying to label it left-wing or right-wing would really kill the deeper meanings in the film. The story is quite simple as a poor family from Oklahoma are kicked off their land and they decide to travel West where they think plenty of work will await them. The family heads off for a better life but soon they're hit with one heartbreak after another. Having watched this for the first time in over twenty-years, what really struck me was the simple message of the story and the rather simple tones that director Ford used to get those messages across. This certainly isn't a film that preaches to you but at the same time it's impossible not to deeply feel what it's saying as the film perfectly shows everything that's great about America and what's bad about it. There are so many classic. landmark moments in this film that many others simply get overlooked or are never really discussed at all. One such scene happens early on when the family, slowly breaking apart, enter a diner wanting ten-cents worth of bread but the rather snotty waitress tells them all that's available is fifteen-cents. What follows is certainly very touching and shows what good can come out of people. Of course, there's also the ugly side mainly dealing with, as Tom Joad puts it, millions of acres of land and thousands of farmers going hungry. Ford clearly wanted to make people feel as close to these characters as possible and I think one major reason he succeeds is because of the documentary feel he creates. The natural lighting was the perfect choice because it really makes you feel the dirt that is on all these characters, it makes you feel the baking sun and it makes you feel as if you're along for this sad journey. This journey from Oklahoma to California is filmed in such a way that you can't help but feel for the people going through it but it also gives you this strange feeling that you can follow your dreams no matter how unlikely they are to come true. Many stated that this film is about dreams that go unfulfilled while others see the ending as an incredibly positive thing to give one hope for going forward. I think my feelings are somewhere in between but there's no question the final speech by Tom Joad deserves its place in history.<br/><br/>Henry Fonda plays Tom Joad and that \"simple man\" quality of the actor was certainly very much needed here and there's no question that it was born here. While Fonda turned in many good to very good performances before this film, it's clear that this here is where he really took off and this simple man part is something he would go onto play countless times in his career. Just that laid back approach to the way he walked and talked really took this character off the book pages and made him a film icon. Fonda certainly gets much of the spotlight but the supporting players are all just as impressive. Jane Darwell is perfect as the strong mother, Charley Grapewin as Grandpa, Russell Simpson as Pa Joad and John Qualen as Muley. Eddie Quillan, Frank Sully, Frank Darien, Darryl Hickman, Ward Bond and Joe Sawyer also appear. Then there's John Carradine who turns in one of the finest performances that any actor gave in any film from this era. It's always rather shocking to see how many terrific performances he gave early in his career before turning to \"C\" and \"Z\" pictures towards the end of his life. It's also rather sad that he wasn't given better film parts because his role as Casy.<br/><br/>THE GRAPES OF WRATH was considered for many decades to be the greatest American movie but then the praise for CITIZEN KANE came around and while the Ford film has fallen over the past few decades it's certainly a film that still touches many. I don't think there's anyway to deny the true power as it's almost what one would call the perfect film. Everything on a technical level is top-notch and you're certainly not going to find many more movies with such terrific performances by an entire cast. Some might try to tear it apart for some political reasons but that would really be a shame and it would only show the flaws of said viewer and not the film itself.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Steinbeck's classic comes to life. It's the dust bowl era and the depression. People are driven of their property by the banks. Of course, those banks got those people help getting that property and the depression was a complex collapse. Still, it's sad to see a portrayal of human misery. The Joads pack up everything and head west. Of course, there's the Woody Guthrie song \"If You Ain't Got the Dough Re Me.\" There really isn't an easy answer. California represents the great unknown where the streets are paved with gold and there's work and land for everyone. Naturally, the whole country was wallowing in poverty, and California was pretty well overextended. There's a point where all of us would say, 'It's either me or them.\" Henry Fonda who looks like Jane (or is it the other way around) is young Tom. He can't stand any more of the stuff his family must deal with. He is going to become enterprising. Unfortunately, he finds himself on the wrong side of the law. It's a group of socialists (some would call them dirty Commies) who come to the rescue with their collectivism setting things right. We see things through a filtered glass. John Ford had his own belief system. I felt good and clean when the Joads had some things look up for them, but I realize, also, that it's not so simple. Sometimes there are circumstances that don't qualify as evil--they just are. I hope that we can take a balanced view of the world and help those who need help.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">This tragic tale of the Joad family and their struggles living in the dust bowl during the depression is one of the great literary novels of all time. The movie version has propelled the story to legendary status and is considered one of the greatest movies of all time, sometimes even appearing in the top 10 lists of various film critics and classic movie fans. John Stenbeck's novel also became a great play in the 1990's, one of the few times in the American theater where something already so familiar to audiences could strike a cord and remain as fresh as it had been when it was first written and filmed.<br/><br/>The tragic figure of Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) is a quiet man who has been beaten by life, and there is no getting back up for him. Already having been put in prison for murder, he knows there's no way out for the second time, an accidental killing during a riot involving unsympathetic work camp guards and striking workers. All through his journey is his devoted and loving mother, Ma Joad (Jane Darwell), who provides the voice of reason, still not quite beaten even though she definitely has the weight of the world on her shoulders through the tragedies her family has seen.<br/><br/>If there was ever a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, that is the tragedy of Tom Joad's life. It seems that the fickle finger of fate is constantly pointing at him, making him doomed to suffer at the hands of chance. There's a big heart tucked away inside a soul that longs for release, and he quietly deals with every unfortunate incident of his life with grace and dignity. It is as if his life is one big shrug of the shoulder. There is no bitterness, only acceptance of the fact that this is the way his life is destined. Yet, he doesn't want to see anybody else taken down with him, particularly an embittered former preacher (John Carradine) and a sad little pipsqueak of a man (John Qualen) whom he encounters along the way.<br/><br/>Then, there's his family, sticking together through thick and thin and never any personal judgments, especially against ex-con Fonda. Grandpa Charley Grapewin (\"The Wizard of Oz\", \"Tobacco Road\") jumps up and down with excitement like a little kid, but the same fickle finger of fate that points at Fonda has turned into a visit by death for poor Grandpa. There are no tears in the Joad family, no maudlin cries of \"Why?\", just the realization that they represent the people, always stepped on by those in authority, but some day, those meek people will inherit the earth. Two soliloquies, one by Fonda, another by Darwell, are the glue which holds this together, expressing the depths of their souls and their totally unselfish natures which only long to survive somehow, as long as they are together.<br/><br/>The film has no real conclusion, which represents life which doesn't always have a connecting beginning, middle or end. That's the power of Stenbeck's tale, superbly directed by the amazing John Ford. Every character is there for a purpose, giving some minor players great opportunities to shine. Zeffie Tilbury, the elderly character actress who played bits in some big films and supporting roles in some \"B's\" (and is best known for the feisty old lady whom Spanky, Alfalfa and the rest of \"Our Gang\" encounters in \"Second Childhood\") is moving as Grandma, sitting there quietly and accepting her fate, only briefly mourning her husband.<br/><br/>Darwell, who deservedly won an Oscar, is actually a leading lady in this film, but in 1940 Hollywood, if you were portly and middle aged, you were deemed as a character actress, and character actresses (unless you were Marie Dressler) were supporting. Fonda lost his much deserved Oscar to old friend James Stewart who won pretty much because he had lost the previous year for a film he had deserved to win for. Such are the Grapes of Wrath, whether they are the bitter grapes of man's inhumanity to man or the honoring of the most honest performance of an actor's career that has nothing to do with ego but everything to do with brilliance.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Nunnally Johnson's adaptation of John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath added a visual imagery and a more upbeat ending to the more grim and downbeat novel.<br/><br/>When Bruce Springsteen released the album The Ghost of Tom Joad the inspiration was the cinematic view of the movie and not the book.<br/><br/>Henry Fonda is Tom Joad released from prison and discovers that his family have lost their farm along with all the others. The farmers have been hit by the dust bowl and the Joad family pack their old jalopy and head from Oklahoma for California for a better life thinking their is plentiful work as crop pickers. In an arduous journey they see the America of the Depression era 1930s, whole families displaced and getting exploited by landowners exploiting cheap labour and the police protecting them and violently breaking up any dissent by the labourers.<br/><br/>The subject matter is certainly forbidding for the time and raw. The references to socialism were toned down by director John Ford but he certainly tackled the exploitation of migrant workers. This is a story of a family trying to stay together against the odds.<br/><br/>Henry Fonda gives a sterling performance as Tom Joad a man who realises that he is destined to fight for social justice after his experiences on the road. He is supported by Jane Darwell as Ma Joad, the glue which keeps the family together in the dark days and John Carradine the fallen preacher Jim Casy, a man who lost his faith but as he headed out along Route 66 with the Joads he discovered socialism.</div>\n",

Having no other honest option other than finding a job to survive, the Joad family is attracted by a pamphlet, offering work in California. They join their savings, buy an old US$ 75,00 truck for transportation and moves to the promised place. There, the job does not exist, and they find indeed violence and prejudice, among other desperate very poor and starving persons. This movie is very sad and touching, with an outstanding direction of John Ford. Henry Fonda, as well as all the cast, has a magnificent performance. This film has not been released on VHS or DVD in Brazil, and yesterday I had the chance of watching this masterpiece on cable television for the first time. A very recommended film, taking place when USA looked like (or was) a Third Country World.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): `Vinhas da Ira'  (`Grapes of Wrath')</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">It's been way too long since I've read the book, and I've seen the movie now a couple of times in the past year. In a political discussion, I'd come across as the conservative, but I don't find issue here with the struggle of the Joad's to find a better life for themselves. History can't easily be defined in black and white terms, and the idea that government programs can be legitimately used to provide for citizens in dire need is to be commended. Those same programs, when used to create class warfare is where I take issue. Because director John Ford was such good friends with conservative stalwarts like John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart, one would think that he was a Republican as well. In fact, he was an activist liberal Democrat, who admired FDR and JFK. So perhaps it's true he was stirring the pot with this picture, pitting the haves against the have-nots in a way that can be viewed as left leaning. The term 'Reds' was used a couple of times by Henry Fonda in the picture in a questioning way.<br/><br/>All that aside, \"The Grapes of Wrath\" is one of the truly great movie classics of all time. It works as story telling and as pure cinema. Ford's direction is impeccable and Gregg Toland's work with the camera is among the best in the business. The characters are perfectly cast, and even though Ford was working with a stock group of his players (Fonda, John Carradine, Ward Bond), their work in the picture transcends their personalities. For Fonda and Carradine, this has to rank right up there as among their best work. The other outstanding performance undoubtedly belongs to Jane Darwell, Best Actress for her role as Ma Joad, keeping the family together through every bad turn the road takes them.<br/><br/>There are so many riveting scenes in the picture that it's hard to pick a favorite. But perhaps the most touching one for me was when Pa Joad takes Winfield and Ruthie into Bert's Diner while on the road. Bert orders the waitress to honor Pa's request to buy a dime's worth of bread, as Pa also contemplates a two for a penny candy purchase for the youngsters. While the truck drivers watching this exchange seem to be derisive in their observation, it's they who make good for the nickel candy. In that brief moment, Ford captures everything anyone needs to know about the good will of Man and the inherent goodness of what it means to be an American. You don't replace that with government programs, or legislate it with fancy sounding bureaucracy.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">A poor Midwest family is forced off of their land. They travel to California, suffering the misfortunes of the homeless in the Great Depression.<br/><br/>Now, I don't claim to understand the historical accuracy of this film. I don't know much about the Great Depression, the Dust Bowl, or the struggles of the Oklahoma natives in the 1930s. But from what I do understand, Steinbeck told it well and John Ford probably toned it down a little to make it palatable for audiences.<br/><br/>Henry Fonda shines here. Although he had already broken out as the title character in \"Young Mr. Lincoln\" (1939), also directed by John Ford, he is said to have really launched his career on \"Grapes of Wrath\" following his Oscar nomination. Indeed, the best was yet to come, with \"12 Angry Men\" (1957) still far down the road.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">From Oscar winning director John Ford (My Darling Clementine, The Quiet Man, Mister Roberts, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance), based on the book by John Steinbeck, this was a film from the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die that I was really going to try and focus on. Basically Tom Joad (Oscar nominated Henry Fonda) has returned home after serving four years in prison for killing a man, and he is joined on his journey by faithless former preacher Casy (John Carradine), and together they find the farm deserted. Tom finds his family who tell him that they were evicted, and the extended family of eight have to pack their things and set on the road to California, and there they hope to find work. The Grandpa (Charley Grapewin) dies from a stroke along the way on Route 66, and they have no choice but to bury his body on a roadside, and after being warned about the lack of jobs at their destination, Grandma (Zeffie Tilbury) dies also before they reach the border. They soon find a travelling camp populated by children, and a man and the sheriff do come offering the family members work, but with no indication of what the salary is, this man with the sheriff is trouble apparently. The sheriff killed the man, and Tom knocked out the sheriff before getting away, and the rest of the family keep travelling until the find a farm that needs workers, but it is suspicious for being surrounded by barbed wire and armed guards. They earn very little money when they accept a job picking pears, and Tom walking around comes across Casy again who is planning a strike with fellow labourers, but then thugs kill Casy and gash Tom. The family move on again and find a US government camp which has much better living conditions, such as toilets and showers, but they are wary of thugs coming and need the sheriff to take control. Tom must go away because the sheriff is looking for him, and he leaves his mother, Ma Joad (Oscar winning Jane Darwell), thinking that she won't see him again, but she is hopeful about the future heading for work in the north. Also starring Dorris Bowdon as Rose-of-Sharon 'Rosasharn' Rivers, Russell Simpson as Pa Joad, O.Z. Whitehead as Al and John Qualen as Muley. Fonda is alright as the one who almost leads the family, and Darwell is indeed intriguing as the mother of the family who is tries to keep spirits up. I will be honest, I didn't really pay enough attention to or understand the plot, and I didn't really understand the leading character's heroism, I'd probably only see it the once, but there are some good moments, costumes and landscapes to just about keep you watching, a reasonably worthwhile classic period drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Film Editing, Best Sound and Best Writing, Screenplay. Tom Joad was number 12 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes &amp; Villains, the film was number 21 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 7 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers. Very good!</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">The movie itself is generally recognized as about as good (or great) as you can get, especially considering that it was shot in 33 days. But it often gets nailed for two scenes, one absent from the film, the other changed drastically. No Rosasharn is not seen in the film nursing the dying old man from her swollen breast. If the scene had been shot in 1939 (or even suggested), the movie would never have been released. The second problem often pointed out is that the ending is too upbeat, what with Ma Joad's carrying on about how men live their lives in jerks while women flow along like Anna Livia Plurabelle, and \"we're the people that live.\" That last scene was written by Zanuck and was almost essential to a successful film in the late 1930s. Of course tragedies had been filmed for years, but ordinarily the tragic hero or heroine had earned his or her fate. Both audiences and authorities would have waxed wroth seeing an honest close-knit family crushed by an American economy that was totally inimical to their welfare. We need to look at art in the context of its time.<br/><br/>From the Marxist perspective that Steinbeck used in writing the novel, Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) is the protagonist but the two most important characters are Ma Joad (Jane Darwell) and Casey the Preacher (John Carradine). Ma represents what Marx called \"false consciousness,\" the tendency to attribute our misery to our own flaws, to bad luck, or God's will. Ma Joad's solution is retrograde -- to hold the \"fambly\" together. Casey, on the other hand, discovers \"class consciousness.\" It's not our fault. The flaw is systemic, and the solution lies in correcting the inequities in the system. Our allegiance has to transcend groups like the family and embrace all the exploited workers. The film endorses not Marx's revolution but a milder form of socialism -- the government-run labor camp with its democratic \"sanitary units\", and the emerging union movement with its collective bargaining. Steinbeck's polemic is more acid. The novel has a reference to the extremely wealthy William Randolph Hearst (better known as Charles Foster Kane) who is described as have \"a mean face and a mouth like a a**hole.\" There aren't many references to communism either in the novel or the film, just a few remarks about \"Who is these Reds, anyways?\" Still pretty bold stuff for the 1930s with the public in one of its periodic Bolshevik scares!<br/><br/>No need for anxiety, though. By the late 1930s the Great Depression was easing up, and World War II was about to bring it to an end. Bakersfield now looks as if Tom Joad had made a successful escape and decided to open a chain of organic food stores. <br/><br/>This is a marvelous film. To single out just one shot, note when the Joads drive through the first starving Hooverville. The camera is mounted on the front of the old truck and travels slowly, without any cuts or dialog, through groups of wary, singularly ratty looking people, men and women, young and old, some resembling photos of criminals from old Police Gazettes, who \"don't look none too prosperous.\" <br/><br/>If nothing else, the film is a valuable corrective to the current view that people are poor because they're lazy. How did one third of a nation become so terribly lazy in the years following the 1929 stock market crash?</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">The Grapes Of Wrath is an interesting, beautifully-filmed, powerful movie, but a story so marred by obvious liberal bias that it takes away from the presentation.<br/><br/>GOOD NEWS: With the fabulous black-and-white contrasts here, I wish John Ford had directed a bunch of film noirs because this sure has the feel of one. Great photography. Henry Fonda is the lead character and does a fine job as usual but Jane Darwell steals the show as the matriarch of the family. John Carradine almost does the same with his ex-preacher role. The scenes of the family all piled on this old jalopy is one that will stay with you.<br/><br/>BAD NEWS: This film was way ahead of its time, left-wing-wise, and it's no wonder it's still such a favorite with the liberal/secular population. Let's start with the \"preacher.\" Right off the bat, we get the typical Hollywood fallen preacher role in which the man has lost his faith and then admits he doesn't have a clue. Later, he gives some of his theology which no Oklahoma preacher would ever believe in. For example, he has no idea what grace is. <br/><br/>Then we have another modern-day Hollywood staple: everyone in authority is portrayed as a ruthless, sadistic thug, from the cops to the leaders of the camps. The only one who is shown to be compassionate is the kindly gentleman who espouses all the virtues of socialism and communism, which Fonda then praises to the hilt the rest of the movie, along with an incredibly stupid monologue on New Age religion.<br/><br/>Liberals/atheists: watch this film! You'll love it. Conservatives/Christians: get out the barf bags.<br/><br/>Cinematography buffs: watch this on DVD, but turn the sound off!</div>\n",

As the brutal police harassed and hassled the emigrants that formed Unions in self-defence and struck for decent fruit- picking wages.This inevitably multiplied the official violence against the newcomers .<br/><br/>A sentimental but enjoyable and dignified epic about a peculiar family that emigrates and suffers famine, despair , starvation and nasty harassment . Dealing with consequences of Great Depression , concerning an impoverished family and giving noteworthy portrayals of some intersting characters. Full of memorable moments, the picture gets excellent acting from Henry Fonda , Jane Darwell, among others . The great Henry Fonda is supported by a great secondary cast as Russell Simpson , John Qualen , Charles Grapewin , Eddie Quillan , Frank Sully , Dorris Bowdon, Grant Michell, War Bond and several others .Special mention for Jane Darwell as the mother of the family, she won deservedly an Academy Award.<br/><br/>It contains a sensitive and emotive musical score by Alfred Newman . And evocative cinematography in black and white by Gregg Toland that captures the stark plainness of the outdoors . This uncharacteristic Hollywood picture was competently directed by John Ford . Classy filmmaker Ford also took an Academy Award for his moving handling of the vintage Steinbeck novel , including a sensitive and stirring ending . Ford directed a lot of masterpieces as Stagecoach, How green was my valley, My darling Clementine, The Quiet Man, Rio Grande, Fort Apache, Wagon master, The man who shot Liberty Valance, Searchers and many others. Rating 7.5/10 .This movie has haunted moviegoers down the years .</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">For a motion-picture made in 1940, this one gets the depression probably more on-target than I have seen in any American work (Bound for Glory might be a short bit behind). This is due to two factors, one a little more obvious than the other. Steinbeck's book (still, sadly, unread by me, though other works like the Pearl are amazing on their own) is called the definitive account of the poverty-stricken mid-American experience in the depression, and it probably is. It allows for a very literary sensibility to form about such an American family like the Joads, who are the kind of folk that you'd think, if there wasn't immediate cynicism to be had with the like, politicians would be addressing first and foremost in speeches as the 'working man' and 'American family'. Sadly ironic then that the film had controversy for depicting some of California as corrupt, and that years later there would be charges on John Ford and Steinbeck of being un-American/communist for their respective work. Steibeck knew what he was doing, that's the short of it.<br/><br/>The second part is that Ford and David O. Selznick had such faith and dedication to the material in making it so straightforward that none of the possible melodramatic fat would be noticeable. This is so pure a work of American familial drama that any sense of sentimentality seems to be stripped away (as opposed to sentiment, there is a difference, as also noted by Scorsese re: Paths of Glory). Considering the cast, such as stars Henry Fonda and John Carradine- plus the quietly scene-stealing performance of Jane Darwell- it almost has the feel here and there of (pre) neo-realism, at least as far as Hollywood could take it. There's such a matter-of-factness to the turns that are taken with the Joads on their journey across the southwest to California- the bulldozers, Tom coming home after killing a man, the deaths of grandpa and grandma (the latter just in time to see California), and the subsequent trials and tribulations of working on near slave wages, that it builds the drama unexpectedly. You want the Joads to keep on going because they've earned the emotional investment honestly.<br/><br/>Only towards the very end, perhaps, does a tinge of the alleged communist &amp;/or socialist stuff leak in, but it's not without some reason. By the time Tom Joad (Fonda) has gone through what's happened, his eyes have grown more empathetic than ever for those around him. His final speech, however full of the low-key gusto that calls out for attention, is effective because of what it means for the character, not even so much for the society at large. What's preceded this spirit for the working man has been very simple, the kind of style that many fans of the movies love Ford's work. It's a road movie essentially, and the story keeps on moving along to point after point that hits home what the Joads, and for that matter other families who've ventured out to California, have to deal with. And while there are some scenes where Ford and his DP Greg Toland move the story along in some stylistic flourishes (i.e. the montage of signs and roads, and the bulldozers in the flashback), the script doesn't allot for any time to take any more breathing room than necessary.<br/><br/>And as far as an adaptation- even without reading the book- it's quite wonderful, particularly where one can see that a scene or a moment that probably had profundity in the wording is given an equal amount of emotional weight by what isn't said (the example I'd give is before the Joads leave Oklahoma, the night before, as Ma is in the house by herself, the somber accordion music in the background, as she looks at old pieces of memories and throwing them bit by bit into the fire- all around it's a masterful scene). And on top of there being a sense of truth in the source to screen (with, of course, the necessary cuts and omissions for 1940 production code standards), the performances are golden. Fonda was rarely better, exemplifying all that was good naturally to him as a persona into his character (this and 12 Angry Men his quintessential socially conscious 'Average-joe' performances); Darwell, as mentioned, takes up the screen in her role of a career; Carradine skates between being truly dramatic and campy, and comes off as, simply, intense.<br/><br/>It's a gripping saga, and it may even surprise those who are expecting it to be an 'old-fashioned' tale of dust-bowl suffering during the depression. It is actually old-fashioned, in the most honorable way a picture from the period can be. A++</div>\n",

This would be a tragedy. Although the political and economic events which shaped the book and the film have receded into history, the power of its story, the vividness with which its human tragedy is unfolded, and the collectively forceful eloquence of its players are undimmed.<br/><br/>Ford and Darwell deserved their Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Awards. Fonda was cheated out of his. (I mean James Stewart's role in The Philadelphia Story is a supporting one, not a lead. Furthermore, Stewart plays the part with all his usual mannerisms - nothing special nor distinctive at all).\n",

Now, I finally did and it even goes beyond my highest expectations... I was prepared to see some class-A drama but everything what this family goes through is even worse than I thought. This famous movie milestone goes about the Joad family. They have to leave everything they own in Oklahoma behind. Them and several other poor families are attracted by California because there is supposed to be work and a place to live. The long trip is filled with misery and when they finally get in California, it seems that they've been deceived once more. There's almost no food and 8 hungry mouths to fill. <br/><br/>It's impossible not to get touched by the Joad family. All the characters are so sad but at the same time so brave. They don't give up and keep fighting...you just have to encourage them while watching this film. The Grapes of Wrath really makes you feel happy you live in this era and in this part of the world. You know stories like this really happened in the old days and they still do in some parts of the world. This kind of film is excellent to make you realize you have nothing to complain about.<br/><br/>The dramatic highlights in this motion picture are countless : The flashbacks about how families are driven away from their homes, the grandfather's \"funeral\" , the mother and son conversation near the end... All these scenes and several other ones are indicators of great drama and brilliant cinema. The Grapes of Wrath received several prices and nominations and it deserved every single one of them. Every element in  it is flawless. Henry Fonda's portrayal of Tom Joad is one of the most intriguing characters ever shown of the screen. He's absolutely brilliant.<br/><br/>\n",

The Joad family are forced to leave their homestead due to the harsh conditions brought by the Great Depression. The Joad's pack up and join the caravan of other Dust Bowl victims and head to California answering the promises of work in the orchards. The Okies struggle to hold on to their pride and dignity as their misfortunes continue. Memorable is the trek down Route 66 to the land of milk and honey. If I've watched this movie once I've watched it two dozen times. Excellent portrayals by Henry Fonda, Jane Darwell, John Carradine, John Qualen, Charley Grapwin and O.Z. Whitehead.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">The Grapes of Wrath is a drama directed by John Ford. It was based on John Steinbeck's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name. It features Henry Fonda,Jane Darwell,John Carradine,Shirley Mills,John Qualen and Eddie Quillan.The screenplay was written by Nunnally Johnson.The film tells the story of the Joads, an Oklahoma family, who, after losing their farm during the Great Depression in the 1930's, become migrant workers and end up in California. The motion picture details their arduous journey across the United States as they travel to California in search of work and opportunities for the family members.<br/><br/>Tom Joad returns to his Oklahoma home after serving jail time for manslaughter. En route, Tom meets family friend Casey, a former preacher who warns Tom that dust storms, crop failures, and new agricultural methods have financially decimated the once prosperous Oklahoma farmland. Upon returning to his family farm, Tom is greeted by his mother, who tells him that the family is packing up for the \"promised land\" of California. Warned that they shouldn't expect a warm welcome in California--they've already seen the caravan of dispirited farmers, heading back home after striking out at finding work--the Joads push on all the same. Their first stop is a wretched migrant camp, full of starving children and surrounded by armed guards. Further down the road, the Joads drive into an idyllic government camp, with clean lodging, indoor plumbing, and a self-governing clientele. When Tom ultimately bids goodbye to his mother, who asks him where he'll go, he delivers the film's most famous speech: \"I'll be all around...Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat...Whenever there's a cop beating a guy, I'll be there and when the people are eatin' the stuff they raise and livin' in the houses they build. I'll be there too.\"<br/><br/>Movies will probably go on improving and broadening themselves; but in any event, The Grapes of Wrath is the most mature picture story that has ever been made, in feeling, in purpose, and in the use of the medium.A potent drama that is as socially important today as when it was made, it is affecting, moving, and deservedly considered an American classic and a great adaptation of the novel.A documentary-styled production for which Ford and cinematographer Gregg Toland demanded painstaking authenticity, it is much more than a classy, old-fashioned history lesson. With dialogue and scenes that rank among the most moving and memorable ever filmed, it's a classic among classics or simply put, one of the finest films ever made.It was often named the greatest American film, until it was dethroned by Citizen Kane.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Those shacks with their scrawny kids and threadbare mothers are right out of a Dorothea Lange photo essay of the Great Depression. Now, I'm no particular fan of director Ford, but he does nail this social protest film, which remains an affecting classic even 70-years later. Production notes indicate Ford had to battle TCF to get as much realism into the movie as he did. Yet, without those revealing touches, the dramatic impact would be sorely undercut.<br/><br/>What impresses me is the similarity of conditions between then and now, that is, between the great Depression of the 1930's and the Great Recession (housing bubble) of the 2000's. Instead of a stock market collapse and a rural Dust Bowl, our era has seen a collapse of housing prices and a loss of jobs that has wiped out trillions in home-owner wealth. The collapse has created a new class of dispossessed as banks move in to repossess overdue mortgages. At the same time, the unemployed hope to find a job before government compensation runs out.<br/><br/>In the movie, uprooted families pack up and move west to new horizons, living in tumble- down shacks along the way. Nowadays, uprooted families are either homeless or live in cars, there being scant new horizons to move to. Meanwhile, nameless bankers and Wall Streeters hover in the moneyed background, profiting off the general misery from behind gated communities. The movie goes easy on the contrast between the few rich and the many poor, but the implications remain embedded in the screenplay, especially when the sheriff evicts the sharecroppers from the land.<br/><br/>This brief comparison is not meant to be political. Rather, it's meant to suggest that certain economic dynamics are still with us, even 70-years later, a parallel making the movie's social topic as relevant now as it was then. Of course, as yet there's no Steinbeck or Ford to dramatize the plight in the moving way of the novel or the film. But then, this new era of collapse is still pretty young.<br/><br/>The film itself remains a triumph of casting, staging, and scripting. It's really Ma Joad's (Darwell) film, her strength and sensitivity a stand-in for migrant resilience as a whole. I'm so glad Ford refused to prettify her appearance in any fashion. Fonda too provides just the right humorless edge, that of a good man rendered an outlaw by onerous conditions of the time. Carradine's preacher may be the most interesting of the characters. Having lost \"The Call\", he's a lost soul amidst the general collapse of all that was familiar. Yet, he retains the capacities of a visionary leader, someone who can help guide the new Israelites into a land of milk and honey. It's part of the movie's tragic sense of dislocation that his new understanding is cut short. <br/><br/>Among many memorable scenes, my favorite is the kids at the roadside diner. The hash- house waitress is a typical sassy type, used to fending off jibes from weary truckers. So, when the deal-making Pa Joad comes in with his two hungry kids, she's at first resistant. But then with the cook pushing, her resistance gives way to the humane person underneath. At the same time, the sentiment proves infectious. And instead of the diner losing money by befriending the needy Joads, the truckers leave a sizable tip. In short, a layer of everyday life is peeled back to show a seldom seen solidarity beneath.<br/><br/>To me, not everything is roses. Ford shows his penchant for broad character humor with Grandpa Joad (Grapewin). I know Grandpa is supposed to be borderline senile; however, his overdone antics threaten to undercut the movie's concern with realistic effects. Also, the waitress's scene ending tribute to the generous truckers is unnecessary. Letting the audience grasp the humane gesture would have been more effective.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, these are small blemishes within a beautifully wrought canvas. My lingering image is the final shot of Tom as he crosses the skyline, a silhouette of the reformist spirit now loose upon the land. My hope is there are many Tom Joads still among us.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I am deeply thankful that Gregg Toland walked the planet and found himself to me in multiple projects. Its somewhat easy to pocket his presence when in the company of a great director. Its why you need to see something like this where his influence is so obvious it is hard to ignore.<br/><br/>Ford isn't a BAD director, so much. He's actually something of a genius in taking life and simplifying it into one or two tosses of simple objects, then framing those simplifications in an effective way. His films work, pure and simple. But that's what they are, pure without challenging ambiguities. And simple in the sense that so-called conservatives politicians mime.<br/><br/>Once you escape the pull of those simplified values you see that his films are a huge waste, fake values manufactured only to support a story strategy; values that have since taken on their own selfish lives.<br/><br/>And here. The story is vapid. The acting trite (excluding Carradine) and offensively staged. Its actually demeaning as if these people suffered not in vain because they can \"teach\" us something. Suffering is suffering, not lessons. <br/><br/>But you won't see the frustrating reduced, artificial here, even with all the obsolete stagecraft. Its because Toland has rendered this so with such remarkable richness that the art of photography overcomes the thing. He captures nuance that Ford cannot see. His documentation surpasses the fact that it is film extras and constructed sets in front of the lens; the lens sees beyond that and gives us genuine pathos, disconnect. Its never in the parts manipulated by Ford in the foreground, but the background elements, the world in which our little play is staged.<br/><br/>There's something about the quality of the film that I think we will never see again. Even the Coens, when trying to reproduce the textures in \"Man Who Wasn't There\" Had to shoot it in color and print it in black and white. In a few years, it will all be digital. It may even look like this sometimes. <br/><br/>But what was happening then, in Kane, here, was that there were chemical memories being formed in catalyzed emulsions in a device, while a master of that device had similar chemical processes working in his brain, and he was able to coordinate the two. Cognition controlled and preserved past death in smoky traces of silver.<br/><br/>Bless you Gregg.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Arguably Director John Ford's Greatest Film, although some might say \"The Searchers\" (1956) or \"My Darling Clementine\" (1946).<br/><br/>But there is No Doubt that this Film Resonates and Captivates with its Story of the Depression's Devastating Effect on a \"Salt of the Earth\" Sharecropper Family with Multi-Generational Roots Planted in the Now Fallow \"Dust Bowl\".<br/><br/>Along with the Personal Hardships the Movie makes much of the Social Separation and Income Inequality of the Time.<br/><br/>There are the Compassion-Less Bankers and Their Minions of Law Enforcement and \"Tin Badge\" Thugs. Socialism/Communism was seen as an Alternative to the Punishing Poverty and Vanishing Opportunities by some and a Threat to Capitalism by the Capitalists.<br/><br/>This is a Solid Background to the Story but Not the Backbone. The Skeletal Structure of the Movie, from John Steinbeck's Pulitzer Prize Winning Novel, is the Joad Family.<br/><br/>Impeccably Acted by Henry Fonda (Tom Joad), Ma (Jane Darwell), and X-Preacher Casey (John Carradine), with Support from Charlie Grapewin (Grandpa), and John Qualen (Muley). The Remainder of the Strong Ensemble of Acting all do Excellent Work and the overall Verisimilitude of the Film is Striking.<br/><br/>Gregg Toland's Haunting and Beautiful Cinematography Captures the Mood of Melancholy and the Film as a Whole is Widely Considered one of the Great Films.<br/><br/>Some Film-Scholars even Rank it \"The Greatest\". This of course is Obviously Objective, but suffice to say it is always a Contender when the Category of \"Best\" or \"Greatest\" arises. This is a Futile Exercise, but Fun.<br/><br/>Powerful, Unforgettable, and Ultimately a Cinematic Experience so Profound with its Realistic Dramatics that the Viewer is Likely to Feel attached to the Story and can Claim to have a \"Little Piece\" of a Big Picture.</div>\n",
